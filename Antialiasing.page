Anti-Aliasing is a method employed by the 3D API to improve image
quality by reducing jagged edges ("jaggies") or aliasing. There are two
main techniques that achieve this: Multi Sample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) and
Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing. A very simplified explanation of the two
is that MSAA simply takes many different sub-pixel samples of a given
polygon pixel while SSAA multiplies the original samples of all pixels.
Because of this MSAA is faster than SSAA while the later also improves
surface aliasing and alpha textures.

What's common to both is that more samples increase the quality of the
anti-aliasing while reducing performance. This is what the x2, x4, x6,
x8, etc. modifiers mean in your graphics driver control panel and in the
[r\_multiSamples](R_multiSamples_%28cvar%29 "R multiSamples (cvar)")
CVar. You should turn off Anti-Aliasing when working with
[DoomEdit](DoomEdit "DoomEdit") to prevent problems.
