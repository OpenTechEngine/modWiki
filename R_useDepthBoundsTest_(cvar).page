Notes
-----

In theory, this increases performance by reducing the work, per light,
the card has to perform. In practice the performance increase is
neglegible. This functionality is only present on the following nVidia
video cards, where it is called "UltraShadow":

-   GeForce FX series: only 5700, 5900 and 5950.
-   GeForce 6 series: all.
-   GeForce 7 series: all.
