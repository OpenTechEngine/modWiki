The vertical and horizontal shear value of the item. Shear is similar to
skewing, and parameters are defined for vertical and horizontal
offsetting. A value of "0, -1" in a
[windowDef](WindowDef_%28GUI_item_type%29 "WindowDef (GUI item type)")
with text, for example, would be similar to oblique (or 'fake italic')
text.

The value of this property cannot be changed at runtime.
