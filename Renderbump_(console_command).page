Description
-----------

This command renders a normal map using both a high polygon and a low
polygon model. The resulting image is intended for use on the low
polygon model.

Usage
-----

At the console type...

    renderbump [model]

Parameters
----------

-   [model] - The low polygon model to be used in game.

Notes
-----

This command gathers all of it's parameters from the material shader
referenced by the low poly model.

Specifically, it looks at the
[renderbump](Renderbump_%28Material_global_keyword%29 "Renderbump (Material global keyword)")
global keyword in the material shader.

Failure to provide the engine with enough free memory to work with can
result in a **cant malloc x megs** error.

It's recommended that you free up as much system memory (RAM) as
possible before issuing this command by closing unnecessary programs and
that you ensure your pagefile (virtual memory) is set to allocate at
least as much hard drive space as your system memory if not one and a
half times that amount.
