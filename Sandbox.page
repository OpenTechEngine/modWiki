### A Sub-Sub-Section

Another Section, with a table!
=============================


| Fruit   | color   | taste   |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Oranges | orange  | sweet   |
| Lemons  | yellow  | sour    |
| Apples  | red     | sweet   |
| Cucumbers | green | disgusting |

And another Subsection with Lists in it
----------------------

List:

* foo
    - foobar
* bar
* baz

List with numbers:

1. first point
2. second point
3. third point
1. fourth point (ha!)

Some term
 ~  a definition, which can even go over
    several lines, if indented accordingly

Another term
 ~  another definition, note that if you leave two spaces  
    at the end of the line, it'll linebreak in the output

# This section is about Code

You can write code-blocks with syntax-highlighting, using three backticks (<code>```</code>) as delimiters
and specifying the programming language for highliting after the begin-of-codeblock-backticks, just like on github:

    ```c++
    int main(int arg, char** argv)
    {
        std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }
    ```

will result in:

```c++
int main(int arg, char** argv)
{
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

If you want to write code in-line, displayed in monospaced font and without parsing any tags, like the `<code>` tag in HTML, just use backticks, e.g.
```
This is some horrible uninteresting text about HTML-tags making text fat, like `<b>` and `<strong>`.
```
