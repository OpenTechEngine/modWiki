These files are recordings usually done for benchmark purposes, they can
have live gameplay or static scenes and are stored in /
[demos](Demos_%28folder%29 "Demos (folder)") . Even after the
introduction of LZW compression in v1.3 they remain big files. These
files are created with two console commands:
[demoShot](DemoShot_%28console_command%29 "DemoShot (console command)")
for static scenes and
[recordDemo](RecordDemo_%28console_command%29 "RecordDemo (console command)")
for rolling demos. Use the
[stopRecording](StopRecording_%28console_command%29 "StopRecording (console command)")
console command to stop a the recording of a rolling demo.

You can playback demos with the
[playDemo](PlayDemo_%28console_command%29 "PlayDemo (console command)")
console command (it works on both types of demos). If you wish to
benchmark using a demo see the
[timeDemo](TimeDemo_%28console_command%29 "TimeDemo (console command)")
and
[timeDemoQuit](TimeDemoQuit_%28console_command%29 "TimeDemoQuit (console command)")
console commands (you should set "
[com\_compressDemos](Com_compressDemos_%28cvar%29 "Com compressDemos (cvar)")
0" in the console to avoid any slowdowns during the benchmark due to
decompression).
