Setup
-----

Well first of all there is a little problem with modifying the network
code. After coding, you need to test it. That's not too easy, because
you will need at least a dedicated server and one client. If you want to
test it with two players, one client and one listen server would be
nice. Cases exist where you even need two clients and one dedicated
server!

The good news is: you don't need multiple computers to test your cool
new network code. You can run all the stuff on one machine. Therefore we
need to run the dedicated server using:

    "doom3ded.exe" +set developer 1 +set fs_game yourmod +set si_pure 0 +exec server.cfg 

and the client using:

    "doom3.exe" +set fs_game yourmod +set si_pure 0 +set developer 1 +set win_allowmultipleInstances 1
    +set r_fullscreen 0 +com_allowConsole 1 +r_brightness 1 +r_mode 4 +connect localhost

So what does all this stuff do?

 +set developer 1 
:   Starts the game in developer mode. Very usefull for debugging stuff.

 +set fs\_game yourmod 
:   Make the game load *yourmod* (Change *yourmod* with your mod's name,
    of course!)

 +set si\_pure 0 
:   This one is very useful because you don't need to pak all your stuff
    into pak files. The game is now allowed to load custom files
    directly.

 +exec server.cfg 
:   Make the server run *server.cfg* which contains all the usefull
    settings and commands

 +set win\_allowmultipleInstances 1 
:   Sets up Doom3 to allow running multiple instances of the game on one
    computer. This is really required, because we the server we just
    started counts as a running instance of Doom 3.

 +set r\_fullscreen 0 
:   This one runs the game in windowed mode. Usefull to access the
    dedicated server while ingame.

 +com\_allowConsole 1 
:   Add this Cvar to enable fast access to the console by pressing
    **\~** . (Or do your prefer pressing **Ctrl + Shift + \~** ?)

 +r\_brightness 1 
:   Changes your game to the default brightness. Forget this and Windows
    will look so bright you could get snow blindness.

 +r\_mode 4 
:   Sets up a default video mode. Presumably 800x600.

 +connect localhost 
:   Connects the game to the dedicated server we just started.

That's it, you should now have two instances of the game running! If
this is not the case, take a look at the console of the server or the
client. See what errors are printed and try fix it. (This may involve
editing your server.cfg.)

Debug Information
-----------------

Now let's a closer look at the Doom3 network code. Using the following
CVars give you more details about the game engine and the current
network traffic:

 com\_showAsyncstats 0|1 
:   This one is engine related. It shows the current outgoing/incoming
    traffic. It is very useful for debugging, because you are able to
    see how much overall traffic your code generates. The important
    value ( on the client ) is the incoming traffic. In contrast to the
    outgoing traffic (mostly usercommands) your server side network code
    will directly influence in the incoming traffic rate. A rule of
    thumb: Just keep it below 6000 b/s and the mod should be running
    fine.

 net\_clientShowSnapshot 0|1|2|3 
:   When enabled this one gives you info about the entities and the
    amount of traffic they generate. They are divided into three groups:
    -   Green - Entity is currently transmitting traffic
    -   Yellow - Entity is a network entity, but not producing any
        traffic (gets deltified away - more on this later))
    -   Grey - Entity is a map entitiy (spawns on the client, when the
        map is loaded)
