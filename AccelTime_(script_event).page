title: AccelTime (script event)
...

Game class
----------

This event operates on an instance of the [game class](Game_class "Game class") type {{{gameclass}}}

Description
-----------

accelTime specifies the duration an object takes to accelerate up to its specified speed.

Usage
-----

*void* accelTime( *float* **time** )

Parameters
----------

-   [time] - Duration of the acceleration in seconds.

Examples
--------

    $my_entity.accelTime(3);

Notes
-----

This script event does not return any values. In the example above it will cause the entity to take 3 seconds to accelerate up to its maximum speed for its particular movement. An entity's accelTime should not be higher than the entity's time. Logically, you can't take 4 seconds to accelerate, when the time for an object is only 2 seconds long.
