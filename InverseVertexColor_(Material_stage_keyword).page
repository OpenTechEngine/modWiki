Description
-----------

The *inverseVertexColor* keyword instructs the engine to multiply the
given stage by the inverse of the vertex color of the mesh to which the
material is applied.

Usage
-----

    inverseVertexColor

Parameters
----------

This keyword does not accept parameters.

Example
-------

The following stage will take the inverse of the vertex color of the
mesh into account...

    {
     map           textures/custom/image1
     inverseVertexColor
    }

Notes
-----

This keyword uses color math where...

    [Image Map] x (1.0 - [Vertex Color]) = [Result]

So for each texel across the surface of a mesh, the color of the image
map and vertex color are sampled and then a result is calculated.

So using the above formula here are some examples...

    1.0 x (1.0 - 1.0)  = 0.0
    1.0 x (1.0 - 0.75) = 0.25
    1.0 x (1.0 - 0.5)  = 0.5
    0.5 x (1.0 - 1.0)  = 0.0
    0.5 x (1.0 - 0.75) = 0.03125
    0.5 x (1.0 - 0.5)  = 0.25

Generally speaking, as the vertex color shifts from black to white, the
image map will darken. If the vertex color is black, result is the same
as the image map. If the vertex color is white, the result is black.

This keyword is commonly used in conjunction with VertexColor to create
a material that blends between two textures based on vertex color. A
very basic example would be like so...

    {
     blend         add
     map           textures/custom/image1
     vertexColor
    }
    {
     blend         add
     map           textures/custom/image2
     inverseVertexColor
    }
