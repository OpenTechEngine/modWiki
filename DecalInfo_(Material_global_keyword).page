Description
-----------

Used in the materials for decal sprites to set how long the decal stays and how it should fade out. (An example of decal sprites are bullet marks.)

Usage
-----

In the global section of your material shader type...

    decalInfo <stay_length> <fade_length> [<start_rgba> <end_rgba>]

Parameters
----------

 stay\_length   
The amount of seconds the decal should stay before starting to fade.

 fade\_length   
The amount of seconds it takes for the decal to fade away.

 start\_rgba   
RGBA colouring the decal will use when spawned.

 end\_rgba   
the RGBA colouring the decal will fade to.

Notes
-----

The RGBA colours used in start\_rgba will be used for stay\_length seconds, after that it will fade to end\_rgba within fade\_length seconds.

The RGBA values are written between parentheses and consist of 4 values. The values are seperated by spaces. (See [rgba](Rgba_%28Material_stage_keyword%29 "Rgba (Material stage keyword)") .)

Example: (opaque white and transparent black)

     (1 1 1 1) (0 0 0 0)
