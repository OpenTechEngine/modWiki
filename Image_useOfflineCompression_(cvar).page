-----

This CVar by itself is not very useful and has to be used with the
[com\_makingBuild](Com_makingBuild_%28cvar%29 "Com makingBuild (cvar)")
CVar and the
[startbuild](Startbuild_%28console_command%29 "Startbuild (console command)")
and [map](Map_%28console_command%29 "Map (console command)") console
commands. See the [modding](Modding "Modding") page for a wholesome use
of this CVar.
