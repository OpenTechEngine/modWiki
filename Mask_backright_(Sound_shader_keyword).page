Description
-----------

The mask\_backright keyword only allows the sound from the shader to be played through the rear right surround sound speaker in a 5.1 setup.

Usage
-----

    mask_backright

Example
-------

    ship_engine_rumble
    {
        mindistance 100
        maxdistance 1000
        volume 10
        looping
        mask_backright
        shakes .1
        sound/last_stand/loop_rumble_backright_b.wav
    }

Notes
-----

When this is in use, sound only comes from that channel when 5.1 surround is used. If you use 2 channel (stereo) sound the channel will be muted and this sound will not be played.
