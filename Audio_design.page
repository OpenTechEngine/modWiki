Audio design is the art of creating audio-content for a game. This field
is generally seperated into the following categories:

 Sound Design 
:   The creation of sound effects such as gun shots and audio-rumbling
    machinery to be used either as parts of actors and objects or as
    looping background sounds for the environment.

<!-- -->

 Musical Composition 
:   The writing and creation of muscial tracks and scores for a game.
    This includes menu music, level tracks, sounds for credits,
    cutscenes etc. Depending on the scope of the game the musical design
    can become very complex.

Audio Format
------------

All audio files used by the id Tech 4 engine employ either the .
[OGG](OGG_%28file_format%29 "OGG (file format)") or the .
[WAV](WAV_%28file_format%29 "WAV (file format)") file format. All valid
sound files have to be either 1 (mono) or 2 (stereo) channel, 16 bit at
11025, 22050 or 44100 Hz. Any sound made with the intention of being
used for surround sound should be in mono. Any sound intended to be used
with
[shakes](Shakes_%28Sound_shader_keyword%29 "Shakes (Sound shader keyword)")
should be a . [WAV](WAV_%28file_format%29 "WAV (file format)") file if
using Doom 3 (the game, not the engine). If you are using Quake 4 an .
[OGG](OGG_%28file_format%29 "OGG (file format)") is perfectly fine as
long as you run
[shakesGen](ShakesGen_%28console_command%29 "ShakesGen (console command)")
to create the
[shakeData](ShakeData_%28Sound_shader_keyword%29 "ShakeData (Sound shader keyword)")
first.

Sound Shaders
-------------

Creating Sounds for the id Tech 4 engine has been refined compared to
older games. This is similar to the [Texturing](Texturing "Texturing")
process which has become more complicated and powerful through the
addition of [material shaders](Material_%28decl%29 "Material (decl)") .
Something similar was introduced for sound design, the so called [sound
shaders](Sound_%28decl%29 "Sound (decl)") which are contained within .
[SNDSHD](SNDSHD_%28file_format%29 "SNDSHD (file format)") files.

Sound Editor
------------

Doom 3 includes an editor which allows sounds to be placed in a level,
and immediately tested in game. To launch the Sound Editor, type
[editSounds](EditSounds_%28console_command%29 "EditSounds (console command)")
in the console. Sound Shaders
[SNDSHD](SNDSHD_%28file_format%29 "SNDSHD (file format)") or individual
sound files are played by speakers dropped in level by the player. Some
parameters of the Sound Shader are editable in the tool, and sounds can
be manually triggered. The s\_drawSounds
[s\_drawSounds](S_drawSounds_%28cvar%29 "S drawSounds (cvar)") command
is useful to view speakers already in the level. These can be selected
by placing your crosshairs over the speaker and pressing the mouse
button.
