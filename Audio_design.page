Audio design
============

Audio design is the art of creating audio-content for a game. This field is generally seperated into the following categories:

Sound Design  
The creation of sound effects such as gun shots and audio-rumbling machinery to be used either as parts of actors and objects or as looping background sounds <span class="plainlinks">[<span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none!important; background: none!important; text-decoration: none"><font color="black">casino</font></span>](http://web.archive.org/web/20120918175150/http://www.casinos-jackpots.net/) for the environment. </span>

<!-- -->

This includes menu music, level tracks, sounds for credits, cutscenes etc. Depending <span class="plainlinks">[<span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none!important; background: none!important; text-decoration: none"><font color="black">international portfolio inc</font></span>](http://web.archive.org/web/20120918175150/http://www.firetown.com/blog/2012/01/11/minimize-investment-risk-with-an-international-portfolio-inc/) on the scope of the game the musical design can become very complex. </span>

Audio Format
------------

All audio files used by the id Tech 4 engine employ either the .[OGG](OGG\_(file\_format)) or the .[WAV](WAV\_(file\_format)) file format. All valid sound files have to be either 1 (mono) or 2 (stereo) channel, 16 bit at 11025, 22050 or 44100 Hz. Any sound made with the intention of being used for surround sound should be in mono. Any sound intended to be used with [shakes](Shakes\_(Sound\_shader\_keyword)) should be a .[WAV](WAV\_(file\_format)) file if using Doom 3 (the game, not the engine). If you are using Quake 4 an .[OGG](OGG\_(file\_format)) is perfectly fine as long as you run shakesGen to create the [shakeData](ShakeData\_(Sound\_shader\_keyword)) first.

Sound Shaders
-------------

Creating Sounds for the id Tech 4 engine has been refined compared to older games. This is similar to the [Texturing](Texturing) process which has become more complicated and powerful through the addition of [material shaders](Material\_(decl)). Something similar was introduced for sound design, the so called [sound shaders](Sound\_(decl)) which are contained within .[SNDSHD](SNDSHD\_(file\_format)) files.

Sound Editor
------------

Doom 3 includes an editor which allows sounds to be placed in a level, and immediately tested in game. To launch the Sound Editor, type [editSounds](EditSounds\_(console\_command)) in the console. Sound Shaders [SNDSHD](SNDSHD\_(file\_format)) or individual sound files are played by speakers dropped in level by the player. Some parameters of the Sound Shader are editable in the tool, and sounds can be manually triggered. The s\_drawSounds [s\_drawSounds](S\_drawSounds\_(cvar)) command is useful to view speakers already in the level. These can be selected by placing your crosshairs over the speaker and pressing the mouse button.
