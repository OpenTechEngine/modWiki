Rect (GUI item property)
========================

The position and size of the item on the screen, in pixels in relation to a 640x480 "virtual" screen, counting from 0. The first two values are the top left corner of the windowdef, and the last two values are its width and height (see the [Invertrect\_(GUI\_item\_property).html invertrect] property for an exception to this).

Also note that, in nested items, the *x* and *y* values are relative to the top left corner of the parent item, not the desktop (main) [WindowDef\_(GUI\_item\_type).html windowDef]. Also, the parent item's border is taken into account, so 0, 0 in a child item would be the topmost, leftmost pixel that is not a border pixel inside of the parent item.
