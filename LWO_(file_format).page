...

Overview
--------

LWO: LightWave Object file format is a propriatary binary file format and is the standard export format used with [LightWave 3D](http://www.newtek.com/ "http://www.newtek.com") and [Modo](http://www.luxology.com/modo/ "http://www.luxology.com/modo/") . Support in other applications is dependant on import/export scripts or plugins. LWO files cannot be editied outside of a 3D application that supports the format, i.e. they cannot be edited in Notepad or similar.

The id Tech 4 engine uses the LWO format for static meshes.

More information on the LWO format can be found in the [LightWave SDK](http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/developer/LW80/index.html "http://www.newtek.com/products/lightwave/developer/LW80/index.html") .

Notes
-----

A LWO to MD5 conversion utitlity can be obtained at [www.doom3world.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20121122073654/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=4595 "http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=4595") .

An MD5camera export script can be downloaded from [www.pcgamemods.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20121122073654/http://www.pcgamemods.com/8120/ "http://www.pcgamemods.com/8120/")

-   Subpatch a.k.a. subdivision surfaces are not supported.
-   Surface properties are not parsed by Doom 3.
-   Models must be composed entirely of triangles.
-   All mesh data must be on a single layer.
-   Each mesh must have exactly one UV map. Doom 3 will not crash if you have more, but textures will behave in unexpected ways, mixing UV maps, using the wrong UV map, etc.
-   Smoothing angle is not supported. In game, smoothing occurs across welded triangles. Seams must be created manually by unwelding vertices.
-   The surface name of each surface in LightWave 3D must match the name of the corresponding material shader in Doom 3.
