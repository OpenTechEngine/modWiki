`dmap [Option] [Filename]`

Parameters
----------

    -   [lightCarve](LightCarve) - Split polygons along light volume edges.
    -   glView - Not functional.
    -   noAAS - Doesn't create [AAS](AAS\_(file\_format)) files.
    -   noCarve - Doesn't cut any surfaces as if they had the [noFragment](NoFragment\_(Material\_global\_keyword)) global keyword.
    -   noClipSides - Doesn't clip overlaping solid brushes.
    -   noCM - Doesn't create [collision map](CM\_(file\_format)).
    -   noCurves - Makes curves invisible but their collision model is still generated.
    -   noFlood - Skips the flooding of the level allowing it to have leaks.
    -   noLightCarve - Doesn't split polygons based on light volume edges. Default behaviour.
    -   noModels - Not functional.
    -   noOpt - Doesn't merge/remove redundant polygons.
    -   noTJunc - Doesn't create T-Junctions and also auto-forces noOpt.
    -   v - Shows additional information whilst compiling.
    -   verboseEntities - Shows additional information on entities like removal of degenerate polygons.
    -   shadowOpt [int] - Sets the static shadow computation optimisation type.
        -   0 - No optimization.
        -   1 - SO\_MERGE\_SURFACES. Default behaviour.

`dmap shadowopt 3 <mapname>`

-   [Filename] - Name of .[MAP](MAP\_(file\_format)) file (without the extension). If your map is in a subfolder of the /[maps](Maps\_(folder)) directory you will need to include the relative path to it, for instance:

`dmap <subfolder>/<mapname>`

Notes
-----

This command will take a .MAP file and generate a .[CM](CM\_(file\_format)), .[PROC](PROC\_(file\_format)) and sometimes one or more .[AAS](AAS\_(file\_format)) files. See also the [map formats](Maps\_(folder)) page and the [testmap](Testmap\_(console\_command)) console command.
