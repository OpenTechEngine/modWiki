Notes
-----

This command will take a .MAP file and generate a .[CM\_(file\_format).html CM], .[PROC\_(file\_format).html PROC] and sometimes one or more .[AAS\_(file\_format).html AAS] files. See also the [Maps\_(folder).html map formats] page and the [Testmap\_(console\_command).html testmap] console command.
