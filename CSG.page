CSG or Constructive Solid Geometry is a set operations common to many
modelling software packages based on primitives (a cube, sphere, cone,
etc.) to create more complex structures. Where it pertains to editing
[id Tech 4](Id_Tech_4 "Id Tech 4") maps, CSG applies only to
[brushes](Brush "Brush") with just two possible operations: boolean
union and difference. The former combines two brushes into one and the
later subtracts pieces off a brush.

Tools of the trade
------------------

The two operations can be achieved through the Selection menu of the
[map editor](Map_editor "Map editor") or the fourth set of buttons in
the toolbar. These are:

### Subtract

This operation is the equivalent of CSG boolean difference and it will
use a brush to carve a hole or shave off a part in another brush.

1.  Select the brush you'll be using to carve.
2.  Move it to the appropriate location.
3.  Click on the Selection \> CSG \> Subtract menu item or the
    thirteenth button in the toolbar.
4.  Delete the selected brush (or move it somewhere else if you wish to
    use to carve some other piece of geometry).

Please note that you haven't actually created a brush with a hole or
with a piece shaven off. Brushes have to always be convex solids so
unlike in other modelling software applications Subtract in the map
editor simply creates the desired solid using as few smaller brushes
possible.

An important fact to bear in mind when subtracting is that your carving
brush will subtract through every brush it comes in contact with (unless
brushes you don't want to affect have the
[qer\_nocarve](Qer_nocarve_%28Material_global_keyword%29 "Qer nocarve (Material global keyword)")
global keyword).

### Merge

This operation is the equivalent of CSG boolean union and will combine
two or more brushes into a single one.

1.  Select all the brushes you want to merge.
2.  Make sure they share at least one side with each other or are fully
    contained by one of the brushes
3.  Click on the Selection \> CSG \> Merge menu item or the fourteenth
    button in the toolbar.

Again, due to the fact that brushes in id Tech 4 engine maps can't ever
be concave structures, this operation will only function on brushes
which maintain this property after being merged. If this isn't possible
the operation is not performed and you'll see the "Cannot add a set of
brushes with a concave hull." message in the console inspector.

### Hollow

This operation is a specialised CSG subtract. It will carve out a hollow
volume inside a brush.

1.  Select the brush you want to make hollow.
2.  Click on the Selection \> CSG \> Hollow menu item or the fifteenth
    button in the toolbar.

As subtract above, you won't actually get a brush with a hollow volume
but six thin brushes for a regular cuboid brush (less for a tetrahedron
brush, a lot more if you use it on a sphere brush). You'll also find
that the resultant brushes don't line up correctly and you will get
z-fighting unless you fix them.

### Clipper

Although not strictly part of the map editor's CSG operations the
clipper tool allows you shave off a piece from a brush just like
subtract or split it in two by creating an invisible plane in the 3D
world and it'll act as a knife of sorts.

1.  Select the brush (or brushes) you want to shave off a part or split.
2.  Click on the Selection \> Clipper \> Toggle Clipper menu item or the
    sixteenth button in the toolbar.
3.  Left click somewhere to set the first vertex of the clip plane. If
    you make a mistake hover the mouse of top of it until the cursor
    changes to a cross and drag it around with the left mouse button.
4.  When you're satisfied, left click again somewhere else to set the
    second vertex of the clip plane. Make sure a line passing through
    both points intersects with the brush in the current view you're in;
    when this happens part of the selected brush which is usually red
    will become yellow.
5.  Optionally, select another viewport and left click again to set a
    third vertex of the clip plane.
6.  The yellow part of the brush is the section that will remain when
    you finish this operation so drag the clip plane's vertices until
    you're satisfied with the plane. Alternatively you can flip the
    normal of the of the clip plane to switch which section becomes
    yellow. You can do this by clicking on Selection \> Clipper \> Flip
    Clip Orientation.
7.  Optionally you may want to split the brush instead of shaving a
    piece off it. If so then click on the Selection \> Clipper \> Split
    Selection. This will keep both the yellow and remaining red parts of
    the brush as separate structures.
8.  If you're not splitting the brush and you're satisfied with the
    position and orientation of the clip plane then click on
    Selection \> Clipper \> Clip Selection.

When you're confortable using the clipper you'll find using the
following [keyboard shortcuts](DoomEdit_hotkeys "DoomEdit hotkeys") a
big help:

-   Ctrl + right click to set the clip plane's vertices.
-   Ctrl + ENTER to flip the plane's orientation.
-   Shift + ENTER to split of the brush.
-   ENTER to execute the clipping.

A word of caution
-----------------

These CSG operations can save time (especially the clipper) but they can
also introduce bugs. Sometimes brushes become infinitely large in one
axis and you'll have to delete them. Other times the newly created
brushes have vertices with positions that fall between the smallest grid
scale. As stated above, the hollow operation will generate z-fighting
and if not careful Subtract can carve unwanted brushes. All these
problems can be manually fixed or reverted through the undo system or
map backups; but if you aren't very experienced with CSG you should
resort to edge and vertex dragging modes.
