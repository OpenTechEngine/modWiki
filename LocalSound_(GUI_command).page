Plays a sound on the player (client) machine.

This seems to be just a shortcut to the [set
command](Set_%28GUI_command%29 "Set (GUI command)") using *cmd* and
*play* parameters. If I had to guess, I'd say this command was added
later in development on the Doom 3 engine, as id Software seems to use
the set version most of the times instead.

Syntax
------

    localSound sound

*sound* is a reference to a sound or sound shader on the game.

Example(s)
----------

    localSound "guisounds_ping2";
