Description
-----------

The **alphaTest** stage keyword makes parts of a diffuse map texture
invisible depending on the alpha channel. If the alpha value of a pixel
is less than the threshold given as the parameter to alphaTest, that
pixel will not be drawn.

This is useful for rendering grids, gratings and so on, where parts of
the texture must be transparent. It does *not* permit partial
transparency of diffusemap textures.

Usage
-----

    alphaTest [cutoff]

Parameters
----------

-   [cutoff] - the alpha value at which point the diffuse stage is
    drawn. Any values less than this are not drawn.

Example
-------

None.

Notes
-----

This is the only way for a diffuse stage to make use of alpha
transparency.

The only other blend mode that allows for alpha transparency is blend
and it does not recieve lighting.

Unfortunately alphatest is limited in that each pixel is either 100%
opaque, or 100% transparent.

While alphaTest is a stage specific keyword, it has an effect on all
stages. To counter that, use the keyword
[ignoreAlphaTest](IgnoreAlphaTest_%28Material_stage_keyword%29 "IgnoreAlphaTest (Material stage keyword)")
in stages where you do not want to apply the alphaTest.

Photoshop 7 does not save transparency information into an alpha channel
when dealing with targa images. You must download the updated [Targa
export
plugin](http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1544 "http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1544")
from [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/ "http://www.adobe.com") . All other
versions of Photoshop work correctly.

Applying an alphatested material to a brush will make it so that the
brush cannot be used to seal off the map from the void. This can be
noticed when the pointfile line goes straight through a brush.
