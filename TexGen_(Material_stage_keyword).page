title: TexGen (Material stage keyword)
...

Description
-----------

The texgen stage keyword modifies the texture coordinates of the associated map as required by certain effects, such as skyboxes.

Usage
-----

    texGen <type>

Parameters
----------

The **type** parameter can be any of the following values:

 normal   
Unknown effect.

 skybox   
Set the appropriate texture coordinates for a skybox. The associated stage should be a [cameraCubeMap](CameraCubeMap_%28Material_stage_keyword%29 "CameraCubeMap (Material stage keyword)") .

 wobblesky \<x\> \<y\> \<z\>   
Same as **skybox** , but rotate the coordinates according to the axis given

 reflect   
Use the defined stage map for environment mapping.

Example
-------

The following is a typical skybox map stage.

    {
      blend add
      cameraCubeMap env/someskymap
      texgen skybox
    }

Notes
-----

Setting the "z" component of "wobblesky" to a positive value causes the skybox to rotate continuously around the vertical axis. This is used in Doom 3 in some of the Hell levels.
