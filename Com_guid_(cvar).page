Notes
-----

When the game is started it sends a UDP packet with a 'gameAuth' request
to the id Software master server (the address of the master server is
stored in net\_master0). The 'gameAuth' request contains the CD key for
the main installation and (if installed) the expansion pack.

The master server authenticates the supplied CD keys, generates a guid
value and replies with an 'authKey' packet. The game then stores the
returned guid value in this CVar.

It is speculated that the "client unknown to auth" error is caused by
trying to join a game before validating your CD keys with the master
server.

When the game connects to an online server the value of com\_guid is
used to allow the server to identify the player and either accept or
reject the connection. Mods that have player management (banning etc)
use it to track player data.
