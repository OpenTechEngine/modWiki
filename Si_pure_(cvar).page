Notes
-----

Setting this CVar to 0 will cause the game to load any and all
unarchived assets including gamex86.dll. This is useful when you are
coding as it spares you from archiving your modified .DLL in a
[PK4](PK4_%28file_format%29 "PK4 (file format)") file every time you
want to test a change.

This CVar can only be modified on the command line.
