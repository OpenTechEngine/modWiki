Guisurf (Material global keyword)
=================================

Description
-----------

Attaches a [GUIs.html GUI] to this material.

Usage
-----

In the global section of your material shader type...

`guisurf <gui file> | entity[2|3]`

Parameters
----------

gui file  
The path to the [GUI\_(file\_format).html GUI file] to attach to the surface.

entity  
Lets the mapper set the GUI file to be used on this material by selecting a GUI file for the entity which contains a surface with this material. (Check the "gui" key set on the entity.)

entity2, entity3  
Same as **entity**, except that it will use the GUI file set with the "gui2" or "gui3" parameter.
