A table declaration is nothing more than a definition of a list of
values bound to a name. They are mostly used to iterate a list of common
values in [materials](Material_%28decl%29 "Material (decl)") or [GUI
scripts](GUI_scripting "GUI scripting") . A key example would be lights
that fade in and out or strobe in a clear pattern.

Declaration
-----------

Declaring a table is fairly simple when you look at the syntax.

    table <tablename> { [snap] [clamp] { <data>, <data>, ... } }

The **snap** and **clamp** parameters are optional btu can be used
together. They are explained in detail in the rest of this article. The
**data** consists of single [float](Data_types#float "Data types")
values.

Using a table
-------------

Square bracket operators are used to get a certain value out of a table.
The indexes of the elements start from 0.

    tablename [ <expression> ]

The expression between brackets can result in an integer or floating
point number. You can use the [simple script
operators](SCRIPT_%28file_format%29#Simple_Operators "SCRIPT (file format)") \*,
%, + and - as well, next to the following predefined variables:

-   time: a floating point value which increases continually as the map
    progresses.
-   parm0 - parm11: parameters which can be set from script, game code
    or the map editor.
-   global0 - global7: Unused, although they exist.
-   sound: represents the amplitude of the sound the assigned entity
    generates. Used for pulsing materials synchronized with the sound.

The expression does not need to result in a real index in the table. If
you index an item which does not exist, the game will always return
something. The exact behavior is defined by the mentioned **snap** and
**clamp** parameters.

### Snap parameter

If the **snap** parameter is added, requesting data by the use of a
floating point number will always return the item with the nearest
index. If the parameter is not set, the game will interpolate between
two values.

Let us define two tables:

    table squarewave { snap { 0, 1} }
    table linearwave { { 0, 1 } }

Now requesting **squarewave [ 0.6 ]** will return 1, whereas
**linearwave [ 0.6 ]** will return 0.6 because the game interpolates
between 1 and 0.

Similarly, **squareWave [ 0.3 ]** will return 0 and **linearWave [ 0.3
]** will return - you guessed it - 0.3.

### Clamp parameter

If the **clamp** parameter is added, requesting an index which is less
than 0 or higher than the highest index in the table will return the
first, respectively last element from the table. If the parameter is not
set, the table will wrap around.

Use in materials
----------------

Given the above definitions, we can define a material that uses the
current time, combined with the linear table, to fade an overlay image
in and out

    table linearwave {{ 0, 1 }}

    textures/my_textures/fade_in_out
    {
        qer_editorimage textures/my_textures/fader.tga

        diffusemap      textures/my_textures/fader.tga

        {
            blend add
            map         textures/my_textures/fader_overlay.tga
            rgb     linearwave[ time * 0.5 ]
            }
    }
