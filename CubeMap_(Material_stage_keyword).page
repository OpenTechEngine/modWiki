Description
-----------

The **cubeMap** keyword is used instead of a **map** keyword to specify that the associated stage should render a [cube map](Cube_maps "Cube maps") rather than an ordinary image. Typically a cube map stage would be blended into a material to present the appearance of environmental reflection.

Usage
-----

    cubeMap env/name_without_prefix

Parameters
----------

The path to the cube map images should be given, including the name up to but not including the directional suffixes (\_py, \_ny, \_nx etc)

Example
-------

The following stage blends the env/gen2 environment map onto a material with an alpha value of 0.1.

    {
       blend blend
       cubeMap env/gen2
       alpha 0.1
       texgen reflect
    }

Notes
-----

This keyword expects the six environment map images to use the filename suffixes \_px, \_py, \_pz, \_nx, \_ny, and \_nz.
