This may be needed when the [background
property](Background_%28GUI_item_property%29 "Background (GUI item property)")
uses a variable instead of a constant value, but it does not appear to
be a real property. Variable-based [background
properties](Background_%28GUI_item_property%29 "Background (GUI item property)")
do function without this property, but the texture referred to draws
absolutely-last, even drawing on top of the GUI cursor. This property
would appear to be a workaround, but it does not appear to function, and
is not referenced on iddevnet.com.

Syntax
------

    variablebackground flag
