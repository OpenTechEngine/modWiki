Variablebackground (GUI item property)
======================================

This may be needed when the [background property](Background\_(GUI\_item\_property)) uses a variable instead of a constant value, but it does not appear to be a real property. Variable-based [background properties](Background\_(GUI\_item\_property)) do function without this property, but the texture referred to draws absolutely-last, even drawing on top of the GUI cursor. This property would appear to be a workaround, but it does not appear to function, and is not referenced on iddevnet.com.

Syntax
------

`variablebackground `*`flag`*

Default value
-------------

`0`

Example(s)
----------

`background     "gui::itemicon"`
`variablebackground     1`
