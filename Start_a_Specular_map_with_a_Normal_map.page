Overview
--------

One notable method of starting a Specular map, is basing it on a Normal
map. The advantage with this process is it results in a texture that is
more "shiny" on flat surfaces, and becomes progressively less shiny as
the angle deviates. Most artists will opt to continue modifying the
Specular map after using this method to generate one. Indeed, this
method shouldn't be considered a tutorial on Specular maps from start to
finish, rather it is a good start.

Normal Map
----------

Start with the normal map.

Channels
--------

Copy the red channel, and paste it into a new image.

Paste another copy of the red channel into another new image, and invert
this copy.

Copy the green channel, and paste it into a new image.

Paste another copy of the green channel into another new image, and
invert this copy.

Levels
------

In each of the image documents containing the normal map's channels,
modify the "levels."

-   Select Image \> Adjustments \> Levels (CTRL+L) in Photoshop.
-   Select Tools \> Color Tools \> Levels in The GIMP.

The Input should be set to **128** , 1.0, 255. The Output should be set
to **128** , 255.

This effectively (and accurately) removes all colors with an intensity
less than 128, thus eliminating the dark areas of the images.

All Together
------------

Create a new image. Fill it with 128, 128, 128 (sometimes referred to as
50% Gray).

Copy each of the four documents containing the normal map's modified
channels into four new layers on the new blank image.

-   In Photoshop, set each layer's Blend to Lighten.
-   In The GIMP, set each layer's Mode to Lighten Only.

Inverted
--------

All other documents opened during this procedure may now be closed.

Unless otherwise required, the specular map can now be merged down (or
"flattened") into a single image.

As is, the Specular map describes more light being reflected as the
angle deviates from flat. To reverse this, and make surfaces reflect
more light when they're flat, invert the image.

Ultimately, the Specular map will probably need to have its brightness
reduced (the Layers dialog is also very handy at this), to something
darker. Without further modification, the final result might look like
this:
