A vector is a mathematical quantity having both *magnitude* and *direction* . Common examples of quantities with only magnitude are mass(200kg), temperature(273 degrees Kelvin), and speed (15m/s) (not to be confused with velocity). These are also referred to as *scalar quantities* , because they are described with magnitude only. *Vector quantities* are those which are described with both magnitude *and* direction. Common examples are velocity (15m/s northeast) and force (150nt at 45 degrees).

A 2d vector **a** can be desribed by the equation:

     a = ix + jy

Where **i** is the magnitude of the component in the x plane, and **j** of the y plane.

A 3d vector is described in the same manner, but with 3 components:

     a = ix + jy + kz

With **k** being the magnitude of the z-plane component.

These three components combine to form a vector, representing all three components. For example, for a vector with the equation:

     a = 1 + 2x + -3z

The vector could be represented as a ray from the origin (0,0,0) through the point comprised of those three components. (1,2,-3)

The magnitude (also called *modulus* ) **|a|** of the new *resultant* vector can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem:

     |a|² = x² + y² + z²
     |a|  = √(x² + y² + z²)

*Normalizing* a vector will result in a *normal* (or *unit* ) vector, where the magnitude of the vector is equal to 1. This, in effect, describes only the *direction* of the vector.

To find a normalized vector **â** of vector **a** , divide the vector by it's modulus:

           a
     â =  ---
          |a|

Or

            x
     â.x = ---
           |a|

And so on for y,z,etc.

Since a normalized vector has length of 1,

     √(â.x² + â.y² + â.z²) = |â| = 1
