Description
-----------

Restricts light interaction to those lights with a matching spectrum.
Without a matching spectrum, no illumination takes place. In other
words, the material is invisible until it's illuminated by a light with
a matching spectrum.

Usage
-----

In the global section of your material shader type...

    spectrum [value]

Parameters
----------

-   [value] - an single digit value that defines the spectrum.

Notes
-----

Light spectrum is defined within light shaders using the same keyword.
For example the following material and light shader use the same
spectrum...

    textures/hell/pentastic1_spectrum
    {
            qer_editorimage textures/hell/pentastic1.tga
            DECAL_MACRO
            noShadows
            nonsolid
            noimpact
            twoSided
            translucent
            spectrum 1
            {       
            blend   diffusemap
                    map textures/hell/pentastic1.tga

            }
         
    }

    lights/biground1_snd_spectrum
    {
            spectrum 1      
            {
                    forceHighQuality
                    map     lights/biground1.tga
                    red             sound * Parm0
                    green           sound * Parm1
                    blue            sound * Parm2
                    zeroClamp
            }
    }
