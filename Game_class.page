A game class is a class of [idClass](IdClass_%28class%29 "IdClass (class)") type in the [game code](Coding#game_code "Coding") .

It provides real time type checking and [events](Event_system "Event system") .

The base [spawn class](Spawn_class "Spawn class") [idEntity](IdEntity_%28class%29 "IdEntity (class)") inherits from [idClass](IdClass_%28class%29 "IdClass (class)") .

Events from an instance of a game class can be exposed to the [scripting](Scripting "Scripting") system using a [script event](Script_event "Script event") declaration in the global scripting namespace.
