Game class
==========

A game class is a class of [idClass](IdClass\_(class)) type in the [game code](Coding#game\_code).

It provides real time type checking and events.

The base [spawn class](Spawn\_class) [idEntity](IdEntity\_(class)) inherits from [idClass](IdClass\_(class)).

Events from an instance of a game class can be exposed to the [scripting](Scripting) system using a script event declaration in the global scripting namespace.
