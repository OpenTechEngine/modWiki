Overview
--------

Editing [MIP Maps](MIP_Maps "MIP Maps") is done in the compressed (
[DDS](DDS_%28file_format%29 "DDS (file format)") ) version of the image.
This tutorial will be using [NVIDIA's DDS plug-in for
Photoshop](http://developer.nvidia.com/object/photoshop_dds_plugins.html "http://developer.nvidia.com/object/photoshop_dds_plugins.html")
. Authoring DDS files is, at this time, covered briefly in
[Texturing](Texturing "Texturing") .

Examination
-----------

Open a DDS file in photoshop. Assure that "Load MIP maps" is enabled.

The image with each MIP map level can now be seen. Defects identified in
game should be readily visible. Depending on the compression method
used, compression artifacts can be seen in just one MIP map, several, or
all of them.

Editing
-------

The advantage to NVIDIA's DDS plug-in is the loaded DDS file can be
edited as is. This might run counter to one's expectations, because the
DDS format is described as a "lossy" format. However, this isn't quite
true. While programs that save DDS files must utilize a lossy
compression scheme, the format itself is losslessly compressed. As long
as we're not editing outside of the DDS format (DXT1 in this example),
no loss of data should be observed (i.e. one shouldn't see compounding
artifacts as is evident when opening, editing, and recompressing a
[jpg](JPG_%28file_format%29 "JPG (file format)") image).

Saving
------

Once the image has been edited to suit, save the image. In the save
dialog, be sure to enable "Use Existing MIP maps". Make sure the correct
format is selected (e.g. DXT1 for diffuse and specular, DXT5 for local).

Result
------

The example would look like this in game:

As you can see, anisotropic filtering results in a very smooth blend
from one MIP map level to the next. However, different video cards apply
this filtering in different ways. So please don't rely on MIP maps for
large changes such we've done with this example. It's usually best to
reserve MIP map editing for corrections to compression errors, or
slightly stylizing an image to give it more or less sharpness as its
distance from the player increases.
