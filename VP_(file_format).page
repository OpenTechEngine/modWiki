Description
===========

The .VP files are used for [visual special effects](Vertex_and_fragment_programs "Vertex and fragment programs") . They are regular ASCII text files written in assembler which are parsed and compiled by the engine and OpenGL driver and executed on each vertex. They are similar to . [VFP](VFP_%28file_format%29 "VFP (file format)") files except they only include a vertex program instead of a vertex and fragment program object.
