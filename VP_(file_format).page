VP (file format)
================

Description
===========

The .VP files are used for [visual special effects](Vertex\_and\_fragment\_programs). They are regular ASCII text files written in assembler which are parsed and compiled by the engine and OpenGL driver and executed on each vertex. They are similar to .[VFP](VFP\_(file\_format)) files except they only include a vertex program instead of a vertex and fragment program object.
