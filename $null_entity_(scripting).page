$null entity (scripting)
========================

Means null.

0.

Entity references are initialized null, so can be used to compare to see if they have not been set.

Can be used for object type checking as an object reference will be set to null if its entity does not have a script object of that type.

 ~  Entity pointers are now equivalent to object pointers. $null is equivalent to $null\_entity.
