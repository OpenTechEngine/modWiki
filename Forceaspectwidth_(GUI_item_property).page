This parameter is used to force the GUI renderer to assume a different
aspect ratio for a particular item. So, if you have a GUI that doesn't
fit into the 4:3 normal aspect ratio, you can still use it and have text
with a perfect ratio.

I'm still unsure on how to use this, but apparently, it assumes the new
width is the total width of the item. So a forceaspectwidth of half your
normal width would result on a flatten-looking text.

Also, for this parameter to work, you must place a new, empty
[windowDef](WindowDef_%28GUI_item_type%29 "WindowDef (GUI item type)")
inside the item you're already using. This is because the parameter will
only act on items that are considered *complex* items. More information
