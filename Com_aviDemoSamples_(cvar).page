Notes
-----

The number you specify is how many times the engine will re-draw the
current image in order to "soften" it. However, the AA capabilities on
your video card are far superior in quality and speed so this is not
normally needed. Set the value to 1 to use your video card's
antialiasing. Related CVars:

-   [com\_aviDemoHeight](Com_aviDemoHeight_%28cvar%29 "Com aviDemoHeight (cvar)") -
    You can select the height of each frame.
-   [com\_aviDemoTics](Com_aviDemoTics_%28cvar%29 "Com aviDemoTics (cvar)") -
    You can select how many frames per second should be generated.
-   [com\_aviDemoWidth](Com_aviDemoWidth_%28cvar%29 "Com aviDemoWidth (cvar)") -
    You can select the width of each frame.
