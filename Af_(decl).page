An articulated figure declaration defines the parameters for a ragdoll to react physically in the game. It's purpose is to assign collision bodies and joint restraints to the skeleton of an MD5mesh. These declarations are used explicitly for ragdolls.

Syntax
------

    articulatedFigure [name] {

    settings {
     ...
    }

    body [name] {
     ...

AF declarations are started with a header which consists of the keyword *articulatedFigure* followed by the *name* of the declaration. They are then followed by the body of the declaration which is enclosed in curly brackets.

The body of the declaration consists of three sections, settings, bodies, and joints.

### Settings

    settings {
       key   parms
    }

The settings section contains keys and parameters that apply to the entire articulated figure.

The settings section is started with a header which consists of the keyword *settings* followed by the body. The body is enclosed in curly brackets.

The following keys are used in the body of this section...

### Bodies

    body [name] {
       key   parms
    }

The bodies section contains a list of collision bodies and their respective keys and parameters.

Each collision body is started with a header which consists of the keyword *body* followed by the *name* of the collision body to be declared. They are then followed by the body of the declaration which is enclosed in curly brackets.

There can be multiple collision body declarations in the body section.

The following keys are used in the body of this section...

### Joints

    [jointType] [name] {
       key   parms
    }

The joints section contains a list of joints and their respective parameters.

Each joint is started with a header which consists of a joint type descriptor that defines the joint type followed the *name* of the joint. This is then followed by the body which is enclosed in curly brackets.

There can be multiple joint declarations in the joint section.

The keys used in the body of this section vary depending on what jointType is specified...

Next a shaft is specified which is attached to body1 and is constrained to always stay within the pyramid. |

3D vectors are used to specify positions, directions and orientations of bodies and constraints. There are four ways to specify such a vector in a .af file

| bonecenter( "start joint name", "end joint name" ) | Center of a bone between two joints           |
| bonedir( "start joint name", "end joint name" )    | Direction of a bone from one joint to another |

Editing Tools
-------------

Like other declaration types, articlulated figures can be edited in a text editor. However, the engine comes packaged with a built-in tool for editing these files. It can be accessed using the console command [editAFs](EditAFs "EditAFs") .

Details on this tool's use can be found in the [articulated figure editor](AF_editor "AF editor") article.
