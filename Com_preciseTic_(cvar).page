Notes
-----

There are two threads running in Doom 3, the main thread, and the
'async' thread. The main thread runs the game code, networking, physics,
renderer, etc... The async thread takes care of sound if
[com\_asyncSound](Com_asyncSound_%28cvar%29 "Com asyncSound (cvar)") is
1 or 3 (windows & linux), it also takes care of input if
[com\_asyncInput](Com_asyncInput_%28cvar%29 "Com asyncInput (cvar)") is
1 (it defaults to 0).

The async thread wakes up every 16 milliseconds (60fps) to run an
update. If more than 16ms have elapsed since the last update, it will
run multiple updates to catch up (for example if 51ms have elapsed, it
will run 3 updates). Similarly, if the update is called too soon, it
gets ignored. When com\_preciseTic is set to 0, it skips this bit of
logic and always runs a single update no matter what.
