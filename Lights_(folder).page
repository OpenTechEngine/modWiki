Lights (folder)
===============

This folder contains one or more [.TGA files](TGA\_(file\_format)). Doom 3 loads all .TGA files in this folder and makes them available for use in [light materials](Material\_(decl)) to create 'light styles' that modulate what lights project onto the surfaces of the world.
