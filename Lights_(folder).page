Lights (folder)
===============

This folder contains one or more [TGA\_(file\_format).html .TGA files]. Doom 3 loads all .TGA files in this folder and makes them available for use in [Material\_(decl).html light materials] to create 'light styles' that modulate what lights project onto the surfaces of the world.
