This folder contains one or more [.TGA files](TGA_%28file_format%29 "TGA (file format)") . Doom 3 loads all .TGA files in this folder and makes them available for use in [light materials](Material_%28decl%29 "Material (decl)") to create 'light styles' that modulate what lights project onto the surfaces of the world.
