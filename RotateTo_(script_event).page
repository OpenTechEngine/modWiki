title: RotateTo (script event)
...

Game class
----------

This event operates on an instance of the [game class](Game_class "Game class") type {{{gameclass}}}

Description
-----------

Causes an [entity](Entity "Entity") to perform a rotation along a specified vector.

Usage
-----

*void* rotateTo( *vector* **rotateAxis** )

Parameters
----------

-   [rotateAxis] - The axis around which the entity will rotate.

Examples
--------

    $my_entity.rotateTo( '0 0 90' );

Notes
-----

This script event does not return any values. This event differs from [rotateOnce](RotateOnce_%28script_event%29 "RotateOnce (script event)") in that this rotates an entity to a specific degree on the axis as opposed to adding to the current degree. The above example will cause the entity to rotate to 90 degrees on the z-axis from the entity's 0 angle for the duration that entity's [time](Time_%28script_event%29 "Time (script event)") is set to. If no time is set, the default is 1 second.

 An example of using .time, [accelTime](AccelTime_%28script_event%29 "AccelTime (script event)") , [decelTime](DecelTime_%28script_event%29 "DecelTime (script event)") , and rotateOnce in a short script:

    void rotateCube ()
     {
        $cube.time (5);
        $cube.accelTime (1);
        $cube.decelTime (2);
        $cube.rotateTo ('0 0 180');
     }

This script function will cause an entity named "cube" to rotate to 180 degrees on the Z-axis, within a time period of 5 seconds. The entity will take 1 second to accelerate to its top speed, it will rotate for 2 seconds at its top speed and finally it will spend 2 seconds to decelerate from its top speed to the stopped position.
