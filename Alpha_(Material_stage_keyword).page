Description
-----------

The **alpha** keyword multiples the alpha channel of the associated map by the given value. Use of this keyword only makes sense with [blend modes](Blend_%28Material_stage_keyword%29 "Blend (Material stage keyword)") that respond to alpha, such as the **blend** blend mode.

Usage
-----

    alpha <alphaval>

Parameters
----------

-   *alphaval* - the value by which the alpha channel of the image map should be multiplied

Example
-------

The following stage blends an image with an alpha value of half its original alpha channel

    {
       blend blend
       map path/to/image.tga
       alpha 0.5
    }

Notes
-----

An image with no transparency has an alpha channel of constant 1.0, therefore this keyword can be used even for images which contain no explicit alpha.

Photoshop 7 does not save transparency information into an alpha channel when dealing with targa images. You must download the updated [Targa export plugin](http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1544 "http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1544") from [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/ "http://www.adobe.com") . All other versions of Photoshop work correctly.

 This keyword is particularly useful for controlling the strength of a [mirrorRenderMap](MirrorRenderMap "MirrorRenderMap") or [cubeMap](CubeMap "CubeMap") stage.
