Alpha (Material stage keyword)
==============================

Description
-----------

The **alpha** keyword multiples the alpha channel of the associated map by the given value. Use of this keyword only makes sense with [Blend\_(Material\_stage\_keyword).html blend modes] that respond to alpha, such as the **blend** blend mode.

Usage
-----

`alpha <alphaval>`

Parameters
----------

-   *alphaval* - the value by which the alpha channel of the image map should be multiplied

Example
-------

The following stage blends an image with an alpha value of half its original alpha channel

`{`
`   blend blend`
`   map path/to/image.tga`
`   alpha 0.5`
`}`

Notes
-----

An image with no transparency has an alpha channel of constant 1.0, therefore this keyword can be used even for images which contain no explicit alpha.

Photoshop 7 does not save transparency information into an alpha channel when dealing with targa images. You must download the updated [Targa export plugin](http://web.archive.org/web/20080719221641/http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1544) from [Adobe](http://web.archive.org/web/20080719221641/http://www.adobe.com/). All other versions of Photoshop work correctly.

 This keyword is particularly useful for controlling the strength of a mirrorRenderMap or cubeMap stage.
