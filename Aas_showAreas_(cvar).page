Notes
-----

Walk to an area on the map & bring down the console. The console will display the area \# and it's contents flags.

While viewing the game, the outline of the current area the player is in will be outlined in red, with reachabilities to adjoining areas shown with cyan arrows and ids.

If the current position of the player isn't in an area and a PushPointIntoArea succeeds you will see yellow player bounds.

See [AAS](AAS "AAS") for more information on creating the AAS map.
