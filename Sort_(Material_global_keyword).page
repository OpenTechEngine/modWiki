Description
-----------

Changes the "screen layer" a material is drawn in. This global keyword
is mainly used to correct issues with transparent materials.

Such issues become clear when one material furthest away from the viewer
is still drawn on top of a transparent material which is closer in
distance. Modifying the sorting order resolves this by changing the
order in which materials are drawn on the screen.

Usage
-----

In the global section of your material shader type...

    sort <order>

Parameters
----------

-   \<order\> - Defines in which "layer" the material should be when
    sorted.

### Order types

 subview 
:   Always drawn first with any other material drawn on top.

 opaque 
:   Default sort order for opaque textures.

 decal 
:   Obviously used for decals. (Default for transparant textures?)

 far\
 medium\
 close\
 almostNearest 
:   The above 4 orders still leave room to shuffle materials around when
    materials draw on top of each other. (Some of these could be used in
    common model materials)

 nearest 
:   Used for gun flares and other stuff very close to the player.

 postProcess 
:   Highest layer, normally only used for postProcess materials and
    programs.

Notes
-----

None.
