Notes
-----

The information displayed:

-   frame - Individual numbered frame.
-   all - How long it took to render the current frame (in
    milliseconds).
-   gfr - How long the game code part needed (in milliseconds).
-   rf - How long the renderer front end needed (in milliseconds).
-   bk - How long the renderer back end needed (in milliseconds).

\

The render front end is responsible for traversing the scene, portal and
view frustum culling, shadow generation, dynamic model generation, and
sorting. The back end is responsible for issuing the actual draw calls
(the back end is what changes when r\_renderer changes).
