Doom 3 comes with a lot of redundant, incomplete or malfunctioning [decl
files](Declarations "Declarations") leading modders to wade through many
assets which shouldn't be there. Eutectic's clean packs override these
broken declarations by commenting them out.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** : These packs were made for DOOM 3 version 1.1. They
still work with the latest version BUT THEY DO NOT WORK WITH THE
RESURRECTION OF EVIL EXPANSION PACK!

It should also be mentioned that as these packs override various
declarations, they can cause adverse effects while running the game.
Therefore, it is wise to only use these packs while level editing and
not while playing the game or testing a map or mod.
