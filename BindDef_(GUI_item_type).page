 *A bindDef from Doom3*

Used to create bindings to keys -- think of it as an [editDef](EditDef_%28GUI_item_type%29 "EditDef (GUI item type)") that only takes one key as input and that automatically binds that key to some command; the GUI system itself performs the input detection and command assigment handling.

This is, of course, used on GUIs that allow the user to change its keyboard bindings, like the control config menus on Doom 3.

Additional properties
