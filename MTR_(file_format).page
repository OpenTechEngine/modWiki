MTR (file format)
=================

These files contain [material declarations](Material\_(decl)). They should be put in
the /[materials](Materials\_(folder)) folder. They are regular ASCII text files.

 ~  *MTR files can also reference [guide declarations](Guide\_(decl)), a way to simplify material shader creation.*
