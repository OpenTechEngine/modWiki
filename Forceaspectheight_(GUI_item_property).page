title: Forceaspectheight (GUI item property)
...

This parameter is used to force the GUI renderer to assume a different aspect ratio for a particular item. So, if you have a GUI that doesn't fit into the 4:3 normal aspect ratio, you can still use it and have text with a perfect ratio.

I'm still unsure on how to use this, but apparently, it assumes the new height is the total height of the item. So a forceaspectheight of half your normal height would result on a tall-looking text.

Also, for this parameter to work, you must place a new, empty [windowDef](WindowDef_%28GUI_item_type%29 "WindowDef (GUI item type)") inside the item you're already using. This is because the parameter will only act on items that are considered *complex* items. More information [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20121120041431/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=3556 "http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=3556") .

The value of this property cannot be changed at runtime.
