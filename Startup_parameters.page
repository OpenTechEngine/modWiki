Startup parameters are remnants of the time that an OS consisted of
nothing more then a console. A command was then started by giving it's
name and optionally some parameters to change the command's behavior.
(Take DOS as an example, or even a modern Linux terminal.) All games
built on the [id Tech 4](Id_Tech_4 "Id Tech 4") engine allow you to
start them with parameters as well to get a specific behaviour.

Shortcuts
---------

Probably, you don't want to use a system console to launch a Doom 3 game
every time you need it. It works, but you would need to start the
console, go to the game's folder and type the command with all it's
parameters. Imagine you would need to do that every time you want to
play... This is where shortcuts come in. Shortcuts save the location of
the command and it's startup parameters.

### Windows

You start by creating a shortcut to the game .exe file. A few ways to do
it:

-   Right click in the desired location and choose New -\> Shortcut.
    Complete the wizard
-   Copy the game's .exe, then right click where you want your shortcut
    to be. Select "Paste Shortcut"
-   Drag the game's .exe with your right mouse button to the desired
    location, then release and choose "Create Shortcuts Here".

After this, right click on the shortcut. Select properties. The field to
be edited is the "Target:" field. For Doom 3, it would look like:

     "c:\program files\doom3\doom3.exe"

To add a startup parameter, click in the target field and add:

    +set r_fullscreen 0

After that, the whole target field should contain:

     "c:\program files\doom3\doom3.exe" +set r_fullscreen 0

If you are more familiar with windows you can also write a .bat file to
run the game with your parameters.

### Linux

By default, Linux does not support shortcuts. The only way to solve this
is by making a script. However, newer window managers might support
shortcuts. Scripting will always work, but it is worth it to check your
window manager's documentation. A few step-by-step procedures are listed
below for common window managers.

#### Linux Scripting

Lots of things are done through scripts. This can range from scripts
which start all background processes when you start your Linux install,
to commands which you can use like regular commands on your command
line.

A basic script consists of nothing more then a list of commands to be
executed by your shell. (Which does all the command line tasks)

To create one, open up your favourite editor. Here's is an example of
what it should look like:

     #!/bin/sh
     cd /opt/doom3/
     exec ./doom3 +set r_fullscreen 0

Now save it. The name does not matter, as long as you remember it.

You can already use this script to start the game with the specified
parameters. For example, if the script above was saved in a file called
*d3windowed.sh* , it would be started by typing this in a shell:

     sh d3windowed.sh

It just works. In case the 'sh' part is even too much, you can make the
script file executable on itself. To do this, issue this command:

     chmod ug+x d3windowed.sh

This command marks the script as executable for the file's owner (Here
the user who created it) and members of the file's group. (Most of the
time it's the creator's primary group)

From now on, you can start the script by typing:

     ./d3windowed.sh

What is a valid startup parameter
---------------------------------

You can use any [in-game console
command](Console#Console_commands "Console") as a startup parameter.
This is useful if you always want that command to execute when you start
a game. To make a valid startup parameter, prefix the command with '+'.
If you want to use a [console variable](Console#Cvar "Console") as a
startup parameter you need to prefix it with the
[Set](Set_%28console_command%29 "Set (console command)") command. Some
CVars don't require it but this way you can be sure they will all work
correctly.

Common uses
-----------

### Launching the game in windowed mode

    "d:\doom3\doom3.exe" +set r_fullscreen 0

This makes the game run in windowed mode (ie not full-screen) so you can
keep applications running on the background, and play in the foreground.
It may also be a good idea to add +vid\_restart to ensure that the game
does open in windowed mode. Great for keeping your favourite IM client
or IRC app open in the background.

### Launching the editor

    "d:\doom3\doom3.exe" +set r_mode 3 +set r_fullscreen 0 +seta r_brightness 0 +seta r_gamma 0 +vid_restart +editor

This sets the Doom 3 game resolution to 640x480 (r\_mode 3), makes it
run in windowed mode (not full-screen), sets the brightness and gamma to
0, reloads the rendering engine and loads the map editor. Useful if you
play the game at a lower resolution and want to use the editor at your
normal desktop resolution.

### Launching the game to connect to a server that is running a mod

    "d:\doom3\doom3.exe" +set fs_game MODNAME +connect 123.123.123.123:28004

This starts the game running the mod in the directory "MODNAME", and
then connects to the server at 123.123.123.123:28004

### Launching the game with a different path to save data

    d:\etqw\etqw.exe +set fs_userpath "d:\etqwdata" +set fs_savepath "d:\etqwdata" +set fs_devpath "d:\etqwdata"

<div>

![](/images/7/7e/Etqwsquare_25.png) **Note:** Enemy Territory: Quake
Wars only:
*This will tell the game to save all screenshots, demos, config files,
etc. into the same, custom, directory.*

</div>
