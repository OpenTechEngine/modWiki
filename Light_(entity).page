Notes
-----

Bear in mind a few of the above keys can be modified in realtime with
the 'Light Editor', which is defaulted to J on the keyboard.

A function was added to the light entity in Q4Edit, that allows users to
drag out the light radius with the mouse, as opposed to having to
manually type in dimensions into the light editor.
