Description
-----------

Prevents surfaces with this material from casting shadows onto
themselves but they still cast onto other surfaces.

Usage
-----

In the global section of your material shader type...

    noSelfShadow

Parameters
----------

Not Available.

Notes
-----

Because of the way the [engine](Id_Tech_4 "Id Tech 4") works, surfaces
which have NoSelfShadow set also don't cast any shadows onto any other
surface which also has the NoSelfShadow keyword. See also the
[NoShadows](NoShadows_%28Material_global_keyword%29 "NoShadows (Material global keyword)")
keyword.
