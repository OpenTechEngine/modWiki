Description
-----------

This particular keyword prevents the global effect of the [alphaTest](AlphaTest_%28Material_stage_keyword%29 "AlphaTest (Material stage keyword)") stage keyword from being applied to the current stage.

Usage
-----

    ignoreAlphaTest

Parameters
----------

This keyword does not accept parameters.

Example
-------

    textures/modwiki/exIgnoreAlphaTest {
      DECAL_MACRO
      noshadows
      noselfshadow

      {
        blend diffusemap
        map textures/learning/tst3.tga
        alphaTest 0.5
      }
      {
        blend add
        map textures/decals/blood_drip1
        ignoreAlphaTest
      }
    }

Notes
-----

To elaborate: [alphaTest](AlphaTest_%28Material_stage_keyword%29 "AlphaTest (Material stage keyword)") is a stage specific keyword (i.e. it can only be put in a certain stage, never in the global section) but it has an effect on all stages. So, ignoreAlphaTest disables this effect on the stages where it is specified.
