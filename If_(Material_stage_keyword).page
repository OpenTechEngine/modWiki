Description
-----------

The **if** keyword causes an entire stage to be ignored if the provided condition evaluates to false.

Usage
-----

    if ([cond])

Parameters
----------

[cond] = a boolean expression that evaluates to true or false.

Example
-------

Render one stage or the other depending on the value of a shaderparm...

    {
       if ( parm7 == 0 ) 
       blend   add
       map     textures/object/modconsole6driveyel_add.tga
       rgb     (.3 * sintable [.2 + time ]) +.2
    }
    {
       if ( parm7 == 1 )
       blend   add
       map     textures/object/modconsole6drivegrn_add.tga
       rgb     5
    }

Notes
-----

The uses of conditional statments are endless. Some examples would be textures that react to events or cycle through a series of frames.

The variables which can be referenced, including shaderparms, are defined in doom\_defs.script
