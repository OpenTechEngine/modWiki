Notes
-----

This CVar is changed automatically by the Options \> System \> Advanced
Options \> Antialiasing. Current ATi hardware is only capable of using
up to 6 antialiased samples (using MSAA) while nVidia is capable of up
to 8 samples but only as a MSAA/SSAA combination (only 4 samples using
straight MSAA). What this means is that setting a value higher than 4 or
8 depending on the hardware used will produce no changes. To avoid
overriding this CVar by the settings in the graphics display control
panel, the anti-aliasing settings should be set to "Application
Preference" in the control panel. This CVar requires the
[vid\_restart](Vid_restart_%28console_command%29 "Vid restart (console command)")
console command to produce any change.
