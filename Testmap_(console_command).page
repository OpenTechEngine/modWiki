Testmap (console command)
=========================

Description
-----------

This command compiles a level so it can be played and automatically loads it.

Usage
-----

At the console type...

`testmap [Filename]`

Parameters
----------

-   [Filename] - Name of .[MAP\_(file\_format).html MAP] file (without the extension). If your map is in a subfolder of the /[Maps\_(folder).html maps] directory you will need to include the relative path to it, for instance:

`testmap <subfolder>/<mapname>`

Notes
-----

See the [Dmap\_(console\_command).html dmap] console command for more information on map compilation. Testmap automatically tries to load .[AAS\_(file\_format).html AAS] files so you may see the error "WARNING: Couldn't load AAS file".
