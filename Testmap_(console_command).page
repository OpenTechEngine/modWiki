Description
-----------

This command compiles a level so it can be played and automatically loads it.

Usage
-----

At the console type...

    testmap [Filename]

Parameters
----------

-   [Filename] - Name of . [MAP](MAP_%28file_format%29 "MAP (file format)") file (without the extension). If your map is in a subfolder of the / [maps](Maps_%28folder%29 "Maps (folder)") directory you will need to include the relative path to it, for instance:

<!-- -->

    testmap <subfolder>/<mapname>

Notes
-----

See the [dmap](Dmap_%28console_command%29 "Dmap (console command)") console command for more information on map compilation. Testmap automatically tries to load . [AAS](AAS_%28file_format%29 "AAS (file format)") files so you may see the error "WARNING: Couldn't load AAS file".
