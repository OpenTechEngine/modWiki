Game class
----------

This event operates on an instance of the [game
class](Game_class "Game class") type {{{gameclass}}}

Description
-----------

Causes an [entity](Entity "Entity") to perform a rotation along a
specified vector once.

Usage
-----

*void* rotateOnce( *vector* **rotateAxis** )

Parameters
----------

-   [rotateAxis] - The axis around which the entity will rotate.

Examples
--------

    $my_entity.rotateOnce( '0 0 90' );

Notes
-----

This script event does not return any values. This event differs from
[rotate](Rotate_%28script_event%29 "Rotate (script event)") in that this
is a terminating script event while rotate will force an entity to
rotate for the duration of the game. The above example will cause the
entity to rotate 90 degrees on the z-axis for the duration that entity's
[time](Time_%28script_event%29 "Time (script event)") is set to. If no
time is set, the default is 1 second.

\
 An example of using .time,
[accelTime](AccelTime_%28script_event%29 "AccelTime (script event)") ,
[decelTime](DecelTime_%28script_event%29 "DecelTime (script event)") ,
and rotateOnce in a short script:

    void rotateCube ()
     {
        $cube.time (5);
        $cube.accelTime (1);
        $cube.decelTime (2);
        $cube.rotateOnce ('0 0 180');
     }

This script function will cause an entity named "cube" to rotate 180
degrees on the Z-axis, within a time period of 5 seconds. The entity
will take 1 second to accelerate to its top speed, it will rotate for 2
seconds at its top speed and finally it will spend 2 seconds to
decelerate from its top speed to the stopped position.
