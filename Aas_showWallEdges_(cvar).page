Notes
-----

This displays the walls computed for the AAS. These are the walls the
that AI will see, not walls the player will interact with. Red lines
will form around objects that have AAS computed for them. It only shows
AAS walls parallel to the ground not walls that are verticle. Curves
aren't taken in to account when computing the AAS so they may not appear
if curves are used for the floor/wall.
