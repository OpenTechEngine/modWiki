    }
    if (btn1) {
        sys.println("Run was pressed.");
    }
    if (btn2) {
        sys.println("Zoom was pressed.");
    }
    if (btn3) {

    }
    if (btn4) {
        sys.println("Mouse look was pressed.");
    }
    if (btn5) {
        sys.println("Button 5 was pressed.");
    }
    if (btn6) {
        sys.println("Button 6 was pressed.");
    }
    if (btn7) {
        sys.println("Button 7 was pressed.");

Notes
-----

The value returned bares relation to the status of eight possible
buttons as defined in the SDK under UsercmdGen.h...

    // usercmd_t->button bits
    const int BUTTON_ATTACK         = BIT(0);
    const int BUTTON_RUN            = BIT(1);
    const int BUTTON_ZOOM           = BIT(2);
    const int BUTTON_SCORES         = BIT(3);
    const int BUTTON_MLOOK          = BIT(4);
    const int BUTTON_5              = BIT(5);
    const int BUTTON_6              = BIT(6);
    const int BUTTON_7              = BIT(7);

Each button's status is stored as a single bit in a eight bit binary
number. Each button is represented by either a 1 or 0 which corresponds
with either an on or off state. The resulting binary number therefore
represents the status of each button.

The example above depicts a way to determine which buttons are being
pressed via getButtons.
