Description
-----------

The **deform** keyword applies the specified type of deformation to a
material shader.

Usage
-----

In the global section of your material shader type...

    deform <type> [<parameters>]

Parameters
----------

-   \<type\> - The deformation type to be used.
-   \<parameters\> - The exact definition varies depending on the type
    of deform.

### Types

 eyeBall 
:   Used for eyeball materials on NPCs to allow for pupils to move along
    with whatever the NPC is looking at.

 expand \<amount\> 
:   Expand the surface along it's normals.

 flare \<size\> 
:   Used for light flares which are seen as bloom-like areas around
    light fixtures.

 move \<amount\> 
:   Moves the surfaces along it's X axis.
:   Example:

        deform move (time * 1)

 particle \<particleDecl\> 
:   Emit the specified particles from the surface.

 particle2 \<particleDecl\> 
:   It will emit particles like **particle** while ignoring the surface
    area. As a result, small surfaces emit as much particles as large
    surfaces.

 sprite 
:   Causes any surface to which this material is applied to behave as a
    sprite in that it always faces the player.

 tube 
:   Causes the surface to appear bent around a tube.

 turbulent \<table\> \<range\> \<timeoffset\> \<domain\> 
:   Causes wave-like distortion based on the given table.
:   Example:

        deform turbulent sinTable 0.05 (time * 1) 10

Notes
-----

Any material shaders that make use of the deform keyword coupled with
flare, sprite, tube, eyeball, cannot be illuminated by lights because
these types of deforms are rendered in a separate pass.

The examples, **move** and **expand** types were taken from the [id.sdk:
