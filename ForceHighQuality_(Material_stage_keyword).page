Description
-----------

The **forceHighQuality** stage keyword causes the game to render the
associated stage *without* using [texture
compression](Texturing#Compressed_and_Uncompressed "Texturing") in any
quality mode. Without this keyword, the map would be compressed
according to the defaults for the selected quality mode (bumpmaps only
in High, bumpmaps and diffusemaps in Medium or Low).

This keyword is stronger than
[highquality](Highquality_%28Material_stage_keyword%29 "Highquality (Material stage keyword)")
which only affects Medium and High quality modes. It should only be used
for textures that absolutely must never be compressed.

Usage
-----

    forceHighQuality

Parameters
----------

None.

Example
-------

Forces the diffusemap stage to high quality:

    {
      blend diffusemap
      map textures/path/to/image.tga
      forceHighQuality
    }

Notes
-----

One place where you could use this keyword is the HUD.

![](/images/e/e8/Q4square_25.png) **Note:** Quake 4 only:
*This keyword does not work with
[image\_ignoreHighQuality](Image_ignoreHighQuality_%28cvar%29 "Image ignoreHighQuality (cvar)")
set to 1. That may or not be the case with Doom 3.*
