Animates an item property from one value to another. This is equivalent
to what's usually called an 'easing' or 'tweening' animation somewhere
else. It works a lot like the
[set](Set_%28GUI_command%29 "Set (GUI command)") command, except that it
interpolates the values in-between during a certain time to create
smooth visual transitions.

Syntax
------

    transition property oldValue newValue time [start_inertia stop_force]

*property* is the name of a property in the current item, or a reference
to a property on another item (through the "itemName::propertyName"
syntax).

*oldValue* is the actual or starting value on the animation.

*newValue* is the future or desired value on the animation.

*time* is the time, in miliseconds, that the transition will take. The
transition begins as soon as the command is called, and lasts for the
time declared here.

*start\_inertia* is the starting inertia for the value change. It
defaults to 0 and it means a direct, linear starting animation; the
maximum seems to be 1 and that means it starts slowly and then
accelerates.

*stop\_force* is the stopping force for the change value. It defaults to
0 and that means a direct, linear ending animation; the maximum seems to
be 1 and that means it slowly deaccelerates to a complete stop.

Example(s)
----------

    transition "ObjNew::forecolor" "0.8 1 1 1" "0.8 1 1 0" "200";
    transition "WeapBox::rect" "234 330 408 55" "229 330 408 93" "200" "0" "0.7";
    transition "menu_2::rect" "32, 64, 160, 32" "32, 96, 160,32" "400" "1" "1"; // An 'eased', smooth animation
    transition "menu_2::rect" "32, 64, 160, 32" "32, 96, 160,32" "400" "0" "0"; // A 'linear' animation
