The .aas files contain the [area awareness](AAS "AAS") data for the AI to navigate through the level. A seperate aas file is generated for each size monster. Generally an aas48 and an aas96 file is generated for most monsters sizes. If a map has a special monster in it, such as the mancubus, saboth, guardian, or cyberdemon, then it will generate a special aas file for them.
