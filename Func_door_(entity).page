| triggersize       | sets the amount the trigger extends from the door.                                                                                                                                                              |
| wait              | The duration in seconds until the door closes after it opened. In Doom 3, the default value is **3** seconds.                                                                                                   |

Inheritance
-----------

This entity is derived from the following:

-   *[idEntity](IdEntity_%28class%29 "IdEntity (class)")*
    -   *[idMover\_Binary](IdMover_Binary_%28class%29 "IdMover Binary (class)")*
        -   *[idDoor](IdDoor_%28class%29 "IdDoor (class)")*
            -   **func\_door**

**Note** : Entries marked in italics are classes defined in the SDK.

Notes
-----

-   When the **wait** value is set to **-1** , the door never closes.

<!-- -->

-   To create a door operated only by triggers: set **no\_touch** to **1** , and set **wait** to **-1** .
