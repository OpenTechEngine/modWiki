title: OnTime (GUI item event)
...

Called after a certain time has passed, since after the GUI has been activated. With this event, it's possible to create complex sequential animations, simulating a timeline. Several different onTime blocks can be used on the same item.

The current time applied to an item can also be changed with the [resetTime](ResetTime_%28GUI_command%29 "ResetTime (GUI command)") command, so complex animations can be controlled independently.

Example(s)
----------

    onTime 0 {
        ...
    }
    onTime 100 {
        ...
    }
