Notes
-----

The information displayed with "1":

-   views - Number of drawn camera views.
-   draws - How many draw calls are sent to the GPU.
-   tris - Number of total polygons sent to the GPU.
-   shdw - Number of shadow polygons sent to the GPU.
-   vbo - Number of vertex buffers.
-   image - How much memory is being used by textures in the current
    scene only (it doesn't include frame buffer memory).

The information displayed with "2":

-   v - Same as views above.
-   ds - Same as draws above.
-   t - Number of polygons (after removing the number of shadow
    polygons) / "ambient" polygons.
-   v - Number of vertices (after removing the number of shadow
    vertices) / "ambient" vertices.
-   st - Number of shadow triangles only.
-   sv - Number of shadow vertices only.
-   image - Same as image above.
