Inheritance
-----------

This entity is derived from the following:

-   *[idEntity](IdEntity_%28class%29 "IdEntity (class)")*
    -   *[idPlayerStart](IdPlayerStart_%28class%29 "IdPlayerStart (class)")*
        -   **info\_player\_teleport**

**Note** : Entries marked in italics are classes defined in the SDK.

Notes
-----

Steps to create a working teleporter:

-   Create a [trigger\_multiple](Trigger_multiple_%28entity%29 "Trigger multiple (entity)") as the starting point of your teleporter.
-   Create an info\_player\_teleport as the destination of your teleporter.
-   Connect (Ctrl+K) the trigger\_multiple to the info\_player\_teleport.

Players touching the trigger\_multiple will be transferred to the position of the info\_player\_teleport.

If you want to allow projectiles to fly through your teleporter, you have to modify the trigger\_multiple:

-   Set "anyTouch" key to "1".
-   Set "projectile\_trigger" key to "1".
-   Set "wait" key to "0" to make sure that every projectile gets teleported. The default is 0.5 which causes problems for fast weapons like the nailgun.
-   Change the texture of the trigger\_multiple to "common/trigshotclip".
