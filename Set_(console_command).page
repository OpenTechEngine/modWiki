Description
-----------

This command sets the specified CVar to a given value.

Usage
-----

At the console type...

    set <CVar> <value>

Parameters
----------

-   \<CVar\> - The CVar to modify.
-   \<value\> - the value to set the CVar to. Numbers can be enclosed in quotes.

Notes
-----

If your value is a string, don't forget to put quotes around it. You can sometimes do without, but results may vary if the string contains space characters.

When used in a [startup parameter](Startup_parameters "Startup parameters") Set has expanded functionality than when used in the console. When using set in-game, restrictions are applied. Some CVar's are read-only once the game has started (like some rendering options) to avoid that the game might come in an unpredictable state when those are modified.
