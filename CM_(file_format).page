.CM files store collision model data. Collision models are a [binary
space
partitioning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning")
based format used for collision detection.

They are most commonly used with maps but can also be used with moveable
physics objects.

Syntax
------

[This information needs ported
over](https://web.archive.org/web/20111126225302/http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=151225 "http://www.doom3world.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=151225")

Export
------

The creation of a collision model for use with a map is done
automatically by the engine upon compile with the
[dmap](Dmap_%28console_command%29 "Dmap (console command)") console
command.

To create a collision model for use with a moveable physics object, from
within the level editor, you must select the brushes and/or model. Then
click **Selection \> Export \> to CM** .

From this point the .CM file must be named and placed in the same
directory as the map or model.
