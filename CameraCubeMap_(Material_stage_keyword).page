title: CameraCubeMap (Material stage keyword)
...

Description
-----------

The **cameraCubeMap** keyword is used instead of a **map** keyword to specify that the associated stage should render a [cube map](Cube_maps "Cube maps") rather than an ordinary image. Typically a cube map stage would be blended into a material to present the appearance of environmental reflection.

Usage
-----

    cubeMap env/name_without_prefix

Parameters
----------

The path to the cube map images should be given, including the name up to but not including the directional suffixes (\_forward, \_back, \_left, ect...)

Example
-------

The following stage blends the env/cloudy environment map onto a material...

    {
       blend           gl_dst_alpha , gl_one
       cameraCubeMap   env/cloudy  
       texgen          reflect
       rgb             .6
    }

Notes
-----

This keyword expects the six environment map images to use the filename suffixes \_forward, \_back, \_left, \_right, \_up, and \_down.
