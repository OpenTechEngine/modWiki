The CFG files are ASCII text configuration files present in /
[base](Base_%28folder%29 "Base (folder)") and used by id tech 4 based
games for setting [CVars](Console "Console") , mapping player input to
keys or buttons (see note below), and executing console commands.
Usually the following files are available (by reading order of the
engine):

-   *DoomConfig.cfg* - Stores all the game's options. It's
    auto-generated by the engine so manual editing is not recommended.
    If you delete this file the engine will revert to a *default.cfg*
    file located inside one of the .
    [PK4](PK4_%28file_format%29 "PK4 (file format)") files.
-   *editor.cfg* - Optional. Stores all the
    [DoomEdit](DoomEdit "DoomEdit") relevant options. It's
    auto-generated by the engine so manual editing is not recommended.
-   *autoexec.cfg* - Optional. This file is read last and will override
    any options set elsewhere. It's meant for user-manipulation so you
    can set any CVars here that you'd have to otherwise set in the game
    or editor shortcuts.

You can also create your own custom configuration files to load custom
settings and execute console commands in notepad. You can then load
these files by using the
[exec](Exec_%28console_command%29 "Exec (console command)") console
command in the shortcut or adding the following line to your
*autoexec.cfg* :

    exec myconfig.cfg

You can use two forward slashes to write comments:

    // This is a comment

**Note:** Mapping player input is accomplished through the use of the
[bind](Bind_%28console_command%29 "Bind (console command)") console
command which accepts [console commands](Console "Console") ,
[cvars](Console "Console") , and [impluses](Impulse "Impulse") as valid
input.
