In the Doom 3 [GUI](GUIs "GUIs") system, the developer can choose which font to use on each [GUI item](GUI_items "GUI items") . These fonts are used on the [font property](Font_%28GUI_item_property%29 "Font (GUI item property)") on [GUI scripts](GUI_scripting "GUI scripting") . The default fonts - available on the Doom 3 game assets - are:

    fonts/an
    fonts/bank
    fonts/english
    fonts/micro

Fonts on the Doom 3 engine are composed of [.TGA](TGA_%28file_format%29 "TGA (file format)") and [.DAT](DAT_%28file_format%29 "DAT (file format)") files put together. The font system on this engine is also similar to the Quake 3:Arena font system; Therefore, the same tools used to create custom fonts on Quake 3 can be used on Doom 3.
