## This is the resurrection of **modwiki.net**, a wiki dedicated to modding *[id Tech 4](Id_Tech_4)* games like *[Doom3](Doom_3)*, *[Quake4](Quake_4)*, *[Enemy Territory: Quake Wars](/Enemy_Territory:_Quake_Wars)* or *[Prey]()*.  
The original *modwiki.net* went offline due to spam problems, this wiki is recreated from [archive.org backups of modwiki.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20121205045219/http://www.modwiki.net/wiki/Main_Page).  
All spam has (hopefully!) been removed and we decided to use [Gitit](http://github.com/jgm/gitit/tree/master/) with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) Syntax instead of Mediawiki - we had to convert the articles from HTML anyway, as we only had the pages from archive.org, not the original wiki database (that would have contained the articles in Mediawiki syntax).

Please see [the Categories page](_categories) or the game-specific pages linked below (click their logos) for structured content.

This is still a work in progress, any contribution is welcome.

**To gain write access to the Wiki, just answer to the [corresponding issue on Github](https://github.com/OpenTechEngine/modWiki/issues/7) or ping *kordex* and/or *caedes\_\_* on the [#iodoom3 chan on freenode](irc://irc.freenode.net/iodoom3) and we will add you into the organization.**

The authentication is done using [Gitit's authentication through Github feature](https://github.com/jgm/gitit#authentication-through-github) so you'll need a Github account to log in.  
*(Sorry that you can't register more easily, but this seemed like the best way to prevent spam and so far we indeed had no problems with spam.)*

You can contribute by editing pages like you might be used to from mediawiki or whatever, or you can [clone the whole wiki on Github](https://github.com/OpenTechEngine/modWiki) and submit pull requests for mass editings.  
Note that this wiki doesn't use Mediawiki syntax (as wikipedia and the old modwiki do/did), but [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) with [some extensions](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown). It's mostly the same syntax as used for comments on Github and many other sites. It's really easy to use.

Feel free to use the [Sandbox]() page to try out Markdown!

See also the [Excavated Doom3World forums](https://modwiki.dhewm3.org/doom3world/) which also are a work in progress.
