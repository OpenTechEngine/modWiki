Description
-----------

The **r\_showShadowCount** cvar provides diagnostic information by
colouring pixels based on the number of shadow volumes calculated for
that pixel. The colours used are the same as those given by
**[r\_showLightCount](R_showLightCount_%28cvar%29 "R showLightCount (cvar)")**
, although the shadow-count is per-pixel rather than per-poly.

Usage
-----

At the console type...

    r_showShadowCount [int]

Parameters
----------

-   [int]
    -   0 - Disable.
    -   1 - Enable.

Notes
-----

This CVar is the used similarly to **r\_showLightCount** for
optimisation purposes. Excessive shadow volumes can cause a drop in
performance, while an even greater excess causes ugly rendering
artefacts caused by overflow in the stencil buffer. Shadow count can be
reduced by

-   disabling shadow-casting on some lights
-   adding the key **noshadows** with value **1** to
    [func\_statics](Func_static "Func static")
-   reducing polycount, such as by subdividing [patches](Patch "Patch")
    .
