Notes
-----

The colours represent the number of light interactions as follows:

    Black = 0
    Red = 1
    Green = 2
    Dark blue = 3
    Cyan = 4
    Purple = 5
    White = 6+

Please note that surfaces whose materials use [vertex and fragment
programs](Vertex_and_fragment_programs "Vertex and fragment programs")
are coloured black.

It can also help to set "
[r\_showTris](R_showTris_%28cvar%29 "R showTris (cvar)") 3" and "
[r\_showLightScissors](R_showLightScissors_%28cvar%29 "R showLightScissors (cvar)")
1".
