Description
-----------

The **centerScale** keyword instructs Doom 3 to scale the texture in U
and V dimensions using the specified factors. This keyword differs from
the
[scale](Scale_%28Material_stage_keyword%29 "Scale (Material stage keyword)")
keyword in that it scales from the center as opposed to a corner.

The numbers given are the opposite of what might be expected - scaling
by 2 causes the texture to be made *smaller* by a factor of 2, rather
than bigger. In this sense the values could be considered "tiling"
factors rather than scaling factors.

Usage
-----

    centerScale [U], [V]

Parameters
----------

-   [U] - A floating point value that determines the texture scale on
    the U axis.
-   [V] - A floating point value that determines the texture scale on
    the V axis.

Example
-------

Tile a texture into a 2-by-2 grid relative to its original size.

    {
      blend diffusemap
      map textures/path/to/image.tga
      centerScale 2, 2
    }

Stretch a texture to ten times its original size (probably not a good
idea).

    {
      blend diffusemap
      map textures/path/to/image.tga
      centerScale 0.1, 0.1
    }

Notes
-----

None.
