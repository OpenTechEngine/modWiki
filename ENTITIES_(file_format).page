Overview
--------

Read while loading the level, contains map entity dictionary for each entity in ASCII text. Similar to the [MAP](MAP\_(file\_format)) format, minus the brush and patch definitions.

Map Format Syntax
-----------------

Generally, ENTITIESs consist of entities.

### Comments

The ENTITIES file format supports in-line comments.

To start a comment, place two forward slashes. ( '//' ) Everything behind these markers is ignored.

### Header

The first non-empty/non-comment line contains the header, which currently consists of nothing more than the version.

For Enemy Territory, the header is:

`VersionÂ 1`

### Entities

An entity definition starts by a curly open brace, ( '{' ) and runs on till a matching curly closing brace is found. ( '}' )

The next lines contain the entity's key/value pairs. First comes the name, then the value. Both are enclosed in double quotes, with a space in between.

After those keys and values, one or more brush definitions may follow.

**Note:** An entity should at least have a "spawnclass" key, otherwise unpredictable behaviour might occur.

**Note:** The first entity should have a "spawnclass" key with value "worldspawn". There can only be **one** entity with this spawnclass in a whole ENTITIES file.
