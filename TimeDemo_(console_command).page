Description
-----------

This command plays back a .
[DEMO](DEMO_%28file_format%29 "DEMO (file format)") file and returns the
average framerate.

Usage
-----

At the console type...

    timedemo [Filename] precache

Parameters
----------

-   [Filename] - Name of .DEMO file (without the extension).
-   *precache* - Optional setting that caches all the assets before
    starting.

Notes
-----

When running a timedemo the engine ignores the tic rate (60Hz) and runs
at maximum speed. Unless you use the precache option you should run
timedemo more than once so that the framerate is not affected by
background loading. Demos store the physics and AI of the live run so
during a timedemo the CPU will not be as stressed as if the game was
being played. See also the
[benchmark](Benchmark_%28console_command%29 "Benchmark (console command)")
console command.
