title: Move (script event)
...

Game class
----------

This event operates on an instance of the [game class](Game_class "Game class") type {{{gameclass}}}

Description
-----------

This event causes an entity to move a certain distance along a desired direction.

Usage
-----

*void* move( *constant* **angle** , *integer* **distance** )

Parameters
----------

-   [angle] - The direction the entity will move from the following:

<!-- -->

    UP
    DOWN
    LEFT
    RIGHT
    FORWARD
    BACK
    REL_UP
    REL_DOWN
    REL_LEFT
    REL_RIGHT
    REL_FORWARD
    REL_BACK
    EAST
    NORTH
    WEST
    SOUTH

-   [distance] - The amount of space to travel in game units.

Examples
--------

move upwards 20 units

    $my_entity.move( UP, 20 );

Notes
-----

This event is intended to move an entity along one of six principal directions in either world space or local space.

You can pass an arbitrary number to the script event but you'll find that it only affords you control over the heading. Vertical movement is restricted to either up or down with the exception of relative parameters, where direction is relative to the orientation of the entity.

That said, you could rotate your entity to face the intended path of travel you could tell it to move forward and it would work as intended. This can prove to be tedious however and alternative script events like [moveTo](MoveTo_%28script_event%29 "MoveTo (script event)") or [moveToPos](MoveToPos_%28script_event%29 "MoveToPos (script event)") may be more suitable.

Note that distance can be a positive or negative value; something like ( WEST, -20 ) will actually result in movement 20 units to the East.
