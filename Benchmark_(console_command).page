Description
-----------

Renders the scene with
[r\_screenFraction](R_screenFraction_%28cvar%29 "R screenFraction (cvar)")
set at 100 down to 10 in increments of 10.

Usage
-----

At the console type...

    benchmark

Parameters
----------

This console command does not accept parameters.

Notes
-----

Benchmark doesn't re-run any of the game code and doesn't regenerate
shadows so it's almost completely GPU dependant. More video memory
probably won't help in this case unless that single scene is using more
textures than can fit in vram.
