The *Desktop* is the main [item](GUI_items "GUI items") that makes a
[GUI](GUIs "GUIs") . As the first item, it contains all other items
nested on it, as well as some special [GUI item
events](GUI_item_events "GUI item events") .

The desktop GUI is a
[windowDef](WindowDef_%28GUI_item_type%29 "WindowDef (GUI item type)")
item and follows the same syntax of other items, with a few
reservations. For example:

    windowDef Desktop { 
        rect        0, 0, 640, 480 
        backcolor   0, 0, 0, 1
        ...
    }

You will notice its size (used on the
[rect](Rect_%28GUI_item_property%29 "Rect (GUI item property)")
property) is defined as 640x480. This does not mean this GUI is
restricted for this resolution! Instead, it means it takes the full
screen in any other resolution, as the [GUI](GUIs "GUIs") system uses
these values as a basis for the screen coordinates. In the end, this
makes no difference at all; you just have to remember to design your GUI
screens based on a similar resolution, or calculate the equivalents when
translating your coordinates to the GUI script code.

This is akin to what other games use. For example, the Unreal Tournament
engine uses a maximum screen size of 1x1. In the end, they mean the same
thing, but just uses different powers for parameters.
