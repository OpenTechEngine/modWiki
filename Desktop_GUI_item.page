Desktop GUI item
================

The *Desktop* is the main [GUI\_items.html item] that makes a [GUIs.html GUI]. As the first item, it contains all other items nested on it, as well as some special [GUI\_item\_events.html GUI item events].

The desktop GUI is a [WindowDef\_(GUI\_item\_type).html windowDef] item and follows the same syntax of other items, with a few reservations. For example:

`windowDef Desktop { `
`   rect        0, 0, 640, 480 `
`   backcolor   0, 0, 0, 1`
`   ...`
`}`

You will notice its size (used on the [Rect\_(GUI\_item\_property).html rect] property) is defined as 640x480. This does not mean this GUI is restricted for this resolution! Instead, it means it takes the full screen in any other resolution, as the [GUIs.html GUI] system uses these values as a basis for the screen coordinates. In the end, this makes no difference at all; you just have to remember to design your GUI screens based on a similar resolution, or calculate the equivalents when translating your coordinates to the GUI script code.

This is akin to what other games use. For example, the Unreal Tournament engine uses a maximum screen size of 1x1. In the end, they mean the same thing, but just uses different powers for parameters.
