Description
-----------

The discrete global keyword is used to prevent the map compiler from
merging adjacent polygons that are textured with the associated surface,
even if the texture orientation and alignment is identical.

Usage
-----

In the global section of your material shader type...

    discrete

Parameters
----------

None.

Notes
-----

Discrete surfaces will not be clipped to the world, and it is suggested
that this keyword is used in surfaces like [GUIs](GUIs "GUIs") or
mirrors. Surfaces with this option can be used to facilitate [brush
carving](Brush_carving "Brush carving") , by allowing manually-split
brushes to remain separate after compilation, although extensive use of
this keyword may lead to a suboptimal number of polygons in the map.
