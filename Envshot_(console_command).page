The capture point is the player's current position.

The player is included in captures if the CVar [pm\_thirdperson](Pm_thirdPerson_%28cvar%29 "Pm thirdPerson (cvar)") is enabled.

There have been reports that under certain circumstances this command does not export seamless cubemaps. The current cause is believed to be the screen resolution. The command is reported to work properly when running the game at 640 x 480.
