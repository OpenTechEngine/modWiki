Description
-----------

Defines the parameters for use with the [renderbump](Renderbump_%28console_command%29 "Renderbump (console command)") console command.

Usage
-----

In the global section of your material shader type...

    renderbump [-size <width> <height>] [-aa <aa_value>] [-trace <trace_value>] [-colormap] <image> <model>

Parameters
----------

-   \<image\> - File system path to write the image(s) to, relative to base directory (e.g. "models/mapobjects/crate.tga").
-   \<model\> - The high polygon model to capture normal map data from.
-   [-size \<width\> \<height\>] - Specifies dimensions of the rendered image(s) with \<width\> and \<height\> (image dimensions should be specified in powers of two, e.g. "128"). If not specified, \<width\> and \<height\> default to 256.
-   [-aa \<aa\_value\>] - The amount of antialiasing applied to the normal map (e.g. "0", "1", or "2").
-   [-trace \<trace\_value\>] - The distance from the low poly geometry to begin the raytrace. This is a normalized value, from 0.01 to 1.0. Renderbump performance suffers as this value is increased.
-   [-colormap] - In addition to rendering a bump map, a color map will be produced corresponding to the color of the high poly geometry. The image will be written to the file specified in \<image\> with "\_color" appended to the filename (e.g. "models/mapobjects/crate\_color.tga").

Notes
-----

This command also applies smoothing to the surface of the low poly model.
