Overview
--------

A data type specifies what type of data a variable can hold and must always be present at a variable's declaration.

The script parser uses this to speed up certain operations or complain about impossible operations.

For an introduction on declaring and using variables, see [Variables](Scripting_basics#Variables "Scripting basics") .

Common types
------------

### float

A float type variable can contain any number whether it's an [integer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer") or a [real number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number") .

    float my_var = 23;
    float my_second_var = 0.5;

### vector

A vector type contains three float values, representing a vector. The engine uses this type to store map locations (vector from world origin to position), directions or angles.

When used in a normal assignment, the floats are in the order of 'X Y Z' indicating 3D space coordinates. To access one vector's axis component, append \_x, \_y, or \_z to the variable's name. It should also be possible to use a vector's projection on 1 axis by using the same syntax.

    vector tempvector = '-128 -128 0';
     
    // Changing the x axis value
    tempvector_x = 10;
     
    // Assigning a projected vector to another vector
    vector xcomp = tempvector_x;    // xcomp = '10 0 0' 
     

**Note** : Vectors do not automatically convert to strings, and can't be set to equal floats. In these cases, the separate axis components need to be used. [[1]](http://www.iddevnet.com/quake4/ScriptVariable#vector "http://www.iddevnet.com/quake4/ScriptVariable#vector")

### entity

An [entity](Entity "Entity") reference. Everything in the world is an entity, so this type is used extensively. (See the info on [entities](Scripting_basics#Entities "Scripting basics") in scripting basics)

    entity funcmover;
    funcmover = sys.getEntity("func_mover_1");

### string

A string type contains nothing more then text.

    string blabla = "Put text here";

**Note:** A string variable can be no longer than 256 characters.

### boolean

A boolean type contains a state, true or false. It can't be initialized at declaration, but the un-initialized variable will return zero and be interpreted as false.

    boolean flag;
    flag = 1;
    flag = 0;

### void

Void basically means *nothing* .

**Only to be used with functions!**

Special types
-------------

### object

Named base type of [script object](Script_object "Script object") . Used for more advanced scripting techniques.

### [object type]

Combined entity reference and [script object](Script_object "Script object") type reference. Will be set to [null](%24null_entity_%28scripting%29 "$null entity (scripting)") if the entity you are trying to set the reference to does not have a object of that type.

    monster_base myMonster;
    myMonster = sys.getEntity("monster_sam");
    myMonster.wake_on_trigger();
