title: ReloadScript (console command)
...

Description
-----------

Reloads and recompiles the game scripts at run time.

Usage
-----

At the console type...

    reloadScript

Notes
-----

reloadScript will exit you from the map, so you must reload the map manually from the console. If reloadScript works successfully, you will see this message:

    ***********************************************
    ERROR: Exiting map to reload scripts
    ***********************************************

That is the only error that indicates a success condition. If you see a different error, your script did not compile and the game will not run.
