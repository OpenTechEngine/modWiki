.LANG files are used for localization purposes. For every language there is a different set of files available. Each of these files contains a numbered string that is referenced from within code, GUIs or maps. Each string has to have a unique number so there are no conflicts when referenced. Language strings are simply referenced by typing "\#str\_20000" in the textfield. Replace 20000 with the intended string number.

        "#str_20000"    "Placeholder"
        "#str_20001"    "Placeholder2"
    }
