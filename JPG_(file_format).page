Description
-----------

JPEG is an established lossy compression graphics file format. It
operates on the concept that the human eye doesn't notice certain subtle
changes in color, and that certain colors in these ranges can be removed
from the image in order to allow it to be compressed to a smaller file
size. The term "lossy" is given to the technique due to the fact that,
by removing these ranges of color, the compressed image has lost some of
the quality of the original image.

The high level of compression offered by this format made it very
popular on the web. As the amount of data needed by games has grown
larger and larger, this format has become useful in game development as
well. It must be used with care, however, to ensure that the resulting
in game textures do not suffer from too high of a loss in quality.

Notes
-----

JPEG compression is lossy and results in artifacts. Because of this,
it's recommended that you do not use JPEG images for your normal maps.

JPEG images do not support transparency or alpha channels. This makes
them unsuitable for decals.

When saving JPEG files for use in Doom 3, be sure that you *do not* save
using the "progressive compression" option in your [image
editor](Texturing#Texturing_applications "Texturing") . This will cause
both the editor and the game to crash when it attempts to parse your
image.
