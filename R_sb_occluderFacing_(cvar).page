Notes
-----

This CVar is for the use of shadow buffers and it's not used by Doom 3.
With a usual shadow buffers implementation if you lights take snapshots
of the world and save it as textures. Option "2" render two shadow
buffers: one using the front facing triangles to the light and one using
the back facing triangles to the light and then combines them together
to find a midpoint value between all of the surfaces. Midpoint
renderings is a higher quality option with a performance cost.
