Description
-----------

This CVar sets an optimisation to scissor clip parts of polygons not
visible through visportals, preventing the fragment shader from being
run on non-visible geometry. It also enables light scissors, which limit
each light's calculation to the area of screen space corresponding to
its volume.

Usage
-----

At the console type...

    r_useScissor [bool]

Parameters
----------

-   [bool]
    -   0 - Disable.
    -   1 - Enable.

Notes
-----

This CVar should always be enabled to reduce the number of polygons
processed by the graphics card when they are not visible through
visportals. This optimisation does not function when in
[windowed](R_fullscreen_%28cvar%29 "R fullscreen (cvar)") mode. Despite
this optimisation those polygons are still batched by the CPU and sent
to the GPU, just not drawn; it is therefor recommended turning it off
when testing polycounts with the
[r\_showTris](R_showTris_%28cvar%29 "R showTris (cvar)") CVar.

This CVar also makes a big difference to **light count** - if
r\_usescissor is disabled, the lightcount for a whole polygon will be
equal to the number of lights that touch that polygon at any point. If
r\_usescissor is enabled, the lightcount will increase only within the
portion of the polygon that is contained within the light's own scissor
rectangle (approximately equal to the light volume projected into screen
space).

Note that the r\_usescissor cvar is automatically set to 0 when the
[screenshot](Screenshot_%28console_command%29 "Screenshot (console command)")
command is given, and is reset to 1 (whether or not it was 1 initially)
immediately after the screenshot is written to disk. This has two
effects: the view with scissors enabled cannot be captured, and the cvar
will become activated after a screenshot.
