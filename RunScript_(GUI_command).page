Runs a [script](Scripting "Scripting") defined by the user. This is the real way to extend the GUI functionality: while you can create all kinds of fancy graphics on the GUI, it can't do much feature-wise. To integrate the GUI script with the rest of the game engine, you'll want to use this command to run external scripts or functions.

Notice that a script can also be called using the [set](Set_%28GUI_command%29 "Set (GUI command)") command with *cmd* and *runscript* parameters. id Software used this a lot on their code, as it allows you to call specific functions within scripts.

Syntax
------

    runScript script

*script* is the name of a script to run. On Doom 3, this is usually a reference to a GUI parameter defined on your map, so most GUI scripts can be reused.

Example(s)
----------

    runScript "gui::gui_parm6";
