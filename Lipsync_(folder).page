This folder contains . [LIPSYNC](LIPSYNC_%28file_format%29 "LIPSYNC (file format)") files that control the mouth movement to be in sync with the audiofiles played. Lip syncronisation data is supplied for english, french, italian and spanish. In addition the files also control the general mimic by including parameters such as pain, idle, death, happy etc.

The visemes prameter and the required model animation are not yet understood.
