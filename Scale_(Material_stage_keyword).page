Description
-----------

The **scale** stage keyword instructs the game to scale the texture in U
and V dimensions using the specified factors.

Due to scaling in U and V coordinates, scaling does the opposite of what
might be expected - scaling by 2 causes the texture to be made *smaller*
by a factor of 2, rather than bigger. In this sense the values could be
considered "tiling" factors rather than scaling factors.

Usage
-----

    scale <U scale>, <V scale>

Parameters
----------

 U scale 
:   A floating point value that determines the texture scale on the U
    axis.

 V scale 
:   A floating point value that determines the texture scale on the V
    axis.

Example
-------

Tile a texture into a 2-by-2 grid relative to its original size.

    {
      blend diffusemap
      map textures/path/to/image.tga
      scale 2, 2
    }

Stretch a texture to ten times its original size (probably not a good
idea).

    {
      blend diffusemap
      map textures/path/to/image.tga
      scale 0.1, 0.1
    }

Notes
-----

None.
