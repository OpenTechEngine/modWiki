To change the GUI state (properties and values) or execute a GUI client command.

State change
------------

Set a [property](GUI_item_properties "GUI item properties") or a [variable](GUI_variable_types "GUI variable types") to a given value. This is used to change the appearance or behavior of items during runtime. It doesn't work on all kinds of properties, though, as some of them can't be changed and are marked as so on the [property](GUI_item_properties "GUI item properties") reference.

### Syntax

    set "property" "value";

*property* is the name of a property in the current item, or a reference to a property on another item (through the "itemName::propertyName" syntax) or a reference to a key in the [GUI state dictionary](GUI_state_dictionary "GUI state dictionary") ( through the "gui::keyName" syntax).

*value* the new value that the property will carry.

### Example(s)

    set "buttonTwo::visible" "0";
    set "livePan::rect" "0 0 640 200";
    set "text" "You have clicked me";
    set "gui::somestring" "How long";

#### Additional Note

If you are trying to set one property (property2 - the target property) equal to another property (property1 - the origional property you want to copy) you must reference the first property (property1) using the '$' marker. Using the $ marker lets the parser know that you are referencing another property, not just a string.

    set "property2" "$property1";

Command
-------

Execute a gui command on the client. By using "cmd" as the first property, you tell the game to execute some action on the player's own game. Commands are case insensitive. Commands are either handled by the engine or passed on to the [game code](Coding "Coding") , where there is further differentiation between menus and entities.
