========

[Pk4Scape](http://web.archive.org/web/20100705164430/http://doom3.filefront.com/file/PK4Scape;31661) is an extremely versatile tool for managing .[PK4](PK4\_(file\_format)) files. It provides a dual-paneled interface for browsing a .PK4 file. Instead of the conventional single-panel interface (used by [WinRAR](http://web.archive.org/web/20100705164430/http://win-rar.com/) and others) which can make quick navigation clumsy, this organization makes finding a file or managing assets easier.

Pk4Scape also uses the [zlib](http://web.archive.org/web/20100705164430/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib) compression library to compress .PK4 files. Using this compression can yield extra compression over plain conversion from .[ZIP](ZIP\_(file\_format)).
