[Pk4Scape](http://doom3.filefront.com/file/PK4Scape;31661 "http://doom3.filefront.com/file/PK4Scape;31661")
is an extremely versatile tool for managing .
[PK4](PK4_%28file_format%29 "PK4 (file format)") files. It provides a
dual-paneled interface for browsing a .PK4 file. Instead of the
conventional single-panel interface (used by
[WinRAR](http://win-rar.com/ "http://win-rar.com") and others) which can
make quick navigation clumsy, this organization makes finding a file or
managing assets easier.

Pk4Scape also uses the
[zlib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib")
compression library to compress .PK4 files. Using this compression can
yield extra compression over plain conversion from .
[ZIP](ZIP_%28file_format%29 "ZIP (file format)") .
