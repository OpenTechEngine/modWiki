Scripting is a specific domain of programming. It focuses more on specifying *what* should be done *instead of how* . Mostly read by a script interpreter instead of being compiled to bytecode.

On [id Tech 4](Id_Tech_4 "Id Tech 4") , it is used to allow mappers or modders to change behavior without recompiling the bytecode, only a map restart is needed to parse the script again.

Different fields
----------------

The various forms of scripting in id Tech 4 are:

-   [Level scripting](Level_scripting "Level scripting") - Used for scripting events in levels.
-   [Weapon scripting](Weapon_scripting "Weapon scripting") - Used for defining the behavior of weapons.
-   [AI scripting](AI_scripting "AI scripting") - Used for defining the behavior of monsters and characters.
-   [GUI scripting](GUI_scripting "GUI scripting") - Used for defining the behavior and appearance of game [GUIs](GUIs "GUIs") . Uses a separate scripting system.
