MakeMegaTexture (console command)
=================================

<div style="background: #FFFFCC; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #000000">

**NOTE:** Megatexture functionality is broken in the stock versions of Doom 3, Quake 4, and Prey due to a missing fragment program, megatexture.vfp. However, with a suitable replacement, the information documented in this article is still applicable. At present, you can find a mod that provides you with the necessary file [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20120126043703/http://doom3.filefront.com/file/Megatexture_Technology_Mod;72779).

Description
-----------

This command generates a MegaTexture.

Usage
-----

At the console type...

`makemegatextureÂ [Filename]`

Parameters
----------

[Filename] - Name of .[TGA](TGA\_(file\_format)) file (without the extension).

Notes
-----

This command will take a .TGA file present in the \\megatexture folder and generate a new texture with four components named \<filename\>\_preview.tga and a \<filename\>.MEGA file. This console command seems to be not entirely functional in Doom 3.
