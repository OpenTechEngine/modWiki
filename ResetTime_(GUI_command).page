ResetTime (GUI command)
=======================

Resets the time for a given item. This is used to "go back in time" and restart pieces of code executed on [OnTime\_(GUI\_item\_event).html onTime] event blocks.

Syntax
------

`resetTime [[`*`item`*`] `*`time`*`]`

*item* is the name of the target [GUI\_items.html GUI item] that will have its time changed. If this parameter is omitted, the resetTime command applies to the current item (where this command running from).

*time* is the new time that will be applied to the target item, in miliseconds. If this parameter is also omitted, it assumes time to be 0.
