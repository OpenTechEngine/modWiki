Pointfile
=========

A pointfile is a special file generated during map compilation when there is a leak. This file is created in the same directory and with the same filename as the .[MAP](MAP\_(file\_format)) file but with the .[LIN](LIN\_(file\_format)) extension instead.

To use a pointfile, load [DoomEdit](DoomEdit) and go to File \> Pointfile and the editor will draw a red line. You can then use [shift + ctrl + k](DoomEdit\_hotkeys) and shift + ctrl + l to move back and forth along the line to find the leak.
