title: Comment (GUI item property)
...

A comment as a string. Apparently this should be used somewhere else (maybe there's some dev option to show comments or, more probably, it's viewable by D3Radiant), since it's better to use the // or /\* \*/ notations to place comments on the script source itself.

The value of this property cannot be changed at runtime.

Syntax
------

    comment comments

Default value
-------------

    ""

Example(s)
----------

    comment  "gui_parm1 set value as text for office owner's name\nall text can be set on parm's if you need it"
