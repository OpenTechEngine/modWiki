Notes
-----

This CVar is used primarily to test whether a visportal is working and
how efficient the optimisation is. Portals outlined in green mean they
are open and that all geometry in that area is being processed. When a
portal is red it means the area behind it is being ignored by the
renderer. When they are used, there will always be at least one green
portal. See also the
[r\_useScissor](R_useScissor_%28cvar%29 "R useScissor (cvar)") and
[r\_showTris](R_showTris_%28cvar%29 "R showTris (cvar)") CVars.
