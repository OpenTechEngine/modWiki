Whether or not [onTime
events](OnTime_%28GUI_item_event%29 "OnTime (GUI item event)") will
execute by themselves as soon as the GUI is shown. If this value is set
to 1, they won't execute; instead, a
[resetTime](ResetTime_%28GUI_command%29 "ResetTime (GUI command)")
command should be issued so the animation will run. This is useful to
have separate items with nested animations that are triggered elsewhere
on the script, simulating a kind of timeline control.
