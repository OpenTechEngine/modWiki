Notime (GUI item property)
==========================

Whether or not [onTime events](OnTime\_(GUI\_item\_event)) will execute by themselves as soon as the GUI is shown. If this value is set to 1, they won't execute; instead, a [resetTime](ResetTime\_(GUI\_command)) command should be issued so the animation will run. This is useful to have separate items with nested animations that are triggered elsewhere on the script, simulating a kind of timeline control.
