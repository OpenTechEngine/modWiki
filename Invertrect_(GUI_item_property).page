Whether the
[rect](Rect_%28GUI_item_property%29 "Rect (GUI item property)") of this
item has a normal coordinate system (xy point at top left corner) or an
invert one (xy point at the bottom right corner). By using invertrect 1,
you can resize this item from the right or bottom instead of the normal
top and left position, so it's handier on a few situations (even though
you could do a complete resize on the rect to achieve the same effect).
Using a rect value of "100, 100, 200, 200" is the same as using a rect
value of "300, 300, 200, 200" with invertrect 1. The content of the item
is unaffected (nothing is flipped), and the children items still have
their positions relative to the top left corner of the item. More
