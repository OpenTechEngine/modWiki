![](/images/5/5d/Rtcw2square_bg.png) The information on this page is
specific to [Wolfenstein](Wolfenstein "Wolfenstein") .

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the folder structure of Wolfenstein. It should be noted that
some of these folders are not present in the base folder itself.
Instead, those folders and the assets contained therein are stored in
[PK4 archives](PK4_%28file_format%29 "PK4 (file format)") .

One should also note that since the single player and multiplayer
components are maintained separately, each uses it's own unique folder
structure, executable, library, and assets. They are for all intensive
purposes two independent programs sharing only the title Wolfenstein.
