Description
-----------

The Targa graphics file format is primarily used for the storage of 24- and 32-bit truecolor images.

General File Format Specifications
----------------------------------

Type

Raster Image Format

Extension

\*.TGA

Compression

None, RLE

Color Depth

1- to 32-bits

Notes
-----

RLE compressed images can be read by Doom 3. Since RLE is a lossless form of compression, it can be used without degrading image quality.

24-bit images cannot make use of an alpha channel. Each channel requires 8 bits. In order to make use of an alpha channel you must save your image in 32-bit.

Photoshop 7 does not save transparency information into an alpha channel when dealing with targa images. You must download the updated [Targa export plugin](http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1544 "http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=1544") from [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/ "http://www.adobe.com") . All other versions of Photoshop work correctly.
