A brush is convex volume bounded by four or more planes. Each plane will
form one face of the brush and will have it's own properties. Each face
is stored together with these properties in the mapfile. These
properties include

-   [Material](Material_%28decl%29 "Material (decl)") path
-   Material XYZ shift and scale values
-   Material rotation
-   Detail/Structural ( Seems to be non-existant in Doom 3 )

**Note** : Whenever a concave shape is required, it can be constructed
using multiple brushes.
