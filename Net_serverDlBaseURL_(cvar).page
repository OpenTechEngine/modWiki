Notes
-----

Each custom PK4 must be stored on the file server in a relative mirror
folder structure of that on the game server. Case in point, a PK4 from
the game server might be located at ...

    C:\Program Files\Doom 3\base\map_swd3dm1.pk4

This same file must be stored in a relative location on your file server
such as ...

    http://www.your-web-server.com/doom3/base/map_swd3dm1.pk4

In this case the correct setting for net\_serverDlBaseURL would be ...

    net_serverDlBaseURL "http://www.your-web-server.com/doom3"
