Game class
----------

This event operates on an instance of the [game
class](Game_class "Game class") type {{{gameclass}}}

Description
-----------

Specifies the duration an object takes to decelerate down from its
maximum speed to 0.

Usage
-----

*void* decelTime( *float* **time** )

Parameters
----------

-   [time] - Duration of the deceleration in seconds.

Examples
--------

    Â 
    $my_entity.decelTime(3);

Notes
-----

This script event does not return any values. In the example above it
will cause the entity to take 3 seconds to decelerate from its maximum
speed. An entity's decelTime should not be higher than the entity's
time. Logically, you can't take 4 seconds to decelerate, when the time
for an object is only 2 seconds long.
