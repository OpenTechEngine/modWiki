 *windowDef example preview*

Pretty much the standard visual [item](GUI_items "GUI items") type. When creating [GUIs](GUIs "GUIs") , around 98% of the items you use in your script will be windowDefs. Also, all other item types work as extended windowDefs; from an OOP perspective, think of windowDef as a class and all other item types as being its subclasses.

All in all, a windowDef can contain text strings; it can act as a button; it can work as an static decoration graphic; it can work as an invisible element that serve other scripting purposes, such as containing a code execution timeline; it can also hold specific, separated data.
