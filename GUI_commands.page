Commands are what actually make the [GUI
script](GUI_scripting "GUI scripting") come alive; they're pretty
limited and execute simple tasks. They are used inside [event
blocks](GUI_item_events "GUI item events") and can work with [item
variables](GUI_variable_types "GUI variable types") as well as some
[item properties](GUI_item_properties "GUI item properties") .
