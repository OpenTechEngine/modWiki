GUI commands
============

Commands are what actually make the [GUI\_scripting.html GUI script] come alive; they're pretty limited and execute simple tasks. They are used inside [GUI\_item\_events.html event blocks] and can work with [GUI\_variable\_types.html item variables] as well as some [GUI\_item\_properties.html item properties].
