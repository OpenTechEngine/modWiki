GUI commands
============

Commands are what actually make the [GUI script](GUI\_scripting) come alive; they're pretty limited and execute simple tasks. They are used inside [event blocks](GUI\_item\_events) and can work with [item variables](GUI\_variable\_types) as well as some [item properties](GUI\_item\_properties).
