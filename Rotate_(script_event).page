title: Rotate (script event)
...

Game class
----------

This event operates on an instance of the [game class](Game_class "Game class") type {{{gameclass}}}

Description
-----------

This function causes an entity to continuously rotate N degrees in one second.

Usage
-----

*void* rotate( *vector* **rotateAxis** )

Parameters
----------

[rotateAxis] - The axis around which the entity will rotate in order Y Z X.

Examples
--------

    $my_entity.rotate( '0 0 90' );

Notes
-----

This script event does not return any values. This event differs from [rotateOnce](RotateOnce_%28script_event%29 "RotateOnce (script event)") in that rotate will force an entity to continuing rotating for the duration of the game. The above example will cause the entity to complete a 90 degree rotation on the x-axis in one second then repeat endlessly. The [time](Time_%28script_event%29 "Time (script event)") function has no effect here except in combination with something like [decelTime](DecelTime_%28script_event%29 "DecelTime (script event)") when the time value will then define the duration that the entity continues to rotate.
