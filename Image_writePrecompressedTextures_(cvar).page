Description
-----------

write .dds files if necessary

Usage
-----

At the console type...

    image_writePrecompressedTextures [BOOLEAN]

Parameters
----------

-   [boolean]
    -   0 - Precompressed texture writing is disabled.
    -   1 - Precompressed texture writing is enabled. When Doom3 loads
        an image asset, it will check for a corresponding DDS file. If
        none exists, Doom3 will write the compressed image that it has
        generated to disk within the dds directory corresponding to the
        image's location in the base directory.

Notes
-----

-   Other games based on the Doom 3 engine may write the DDS file to the
    same directory as the original image asset. These games should load
    the DDS file from this location, though Doom 3 does not.
