Text editor
===========

Since id Tech-based games use a lot of [File\_formats.html ASCII text files] here are a few different editors that you can use. Those with [Id\_Tech.html id Tech] specific customisations are listed before generic editors.

**NOTE:** There is a discrepancy in the way Unix, Windows, and Mac operating systems terminate a line of text. The details of which can be read [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20110312235652/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRLF). Because of this, text files created under one operating system may not display properly in another, provided the text editor in use does not take this discrepancy into account. One program that falls victim to this problem is Windows Notepad.

Other utilities to work with text files
---------------------------------------

It's also handy to have a grep tool available to search the contents of multiple [Declarations.html declaration] files for a specific item or pattern. For instance, searching for a specific [Material\_(decl).html material entry] if you are unsure in which .[MTR\_(file\_format).html MTR] file it was located in.
