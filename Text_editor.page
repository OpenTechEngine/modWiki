Since id Tech-based games use a lot of [ASCII text files](File_formats "File formats") here are a few different editors that you can use. Those with [id Tech](Id_Tech "Id Tech") specific customisations are listed before generic editors.

-   Doom 3 - Just type [editDecls](EditDecls_%28console_command%29 "EditDecls (console command)") into the [console](Console "Console") . Please note that some declarations cannot be created this way.

-   [SavageEd](https://web.archive.org/web/20110312235652/http://sevag.krikorian.googlepages.com/savageed "http://sevag.krikorian.googlepages.com/savageed") A very fast, very efficient text editor without the architectural drawbacks of Notepad.

**NOTE:** There is a discrepancy in the way Unix, Windows, and Mac operating systems terminate a line of text. The details of which can be read [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRLF "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRLF") . Because of this, text files created under one operating system may not display properly in another, provided the text editor in use does not take this discrepancy into account. One program that falls victim to this problem is Windows Notepad.

Other utilities to work with text files
---------------------------------------

It's also handy to have a grep tool available to search the contents of multiple [declaration](Declarations "Declarations") files for a specific item or pattern. For instance, searching for a specific [material entry](Material_%28decl%29 "Material (decl)") if you are unsure in which . [MTR](MTR_%28file_format%29 "MTR (file format)") file it was located in.
