Notes
-----

This CVar is for the use of shadow buffers and it's not used by Doom 3.
With a usual shadow buffers implementation lights take snapshots of the
world and save it as textures. This CVar changes the filtering on those
textures as follows:

    GL_NEAREST: Returns the value of the fragment that is nearest to the centre of the pixel being textured.
    GL_LINEAR: Returns the weighted average of the four fragments that are closest to the centre of the pixel being textured.

GL\_NEAREST is faster than GL\_LINEAR, but it can introduce artefacts.
