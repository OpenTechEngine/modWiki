Description
-----------

This keyword instructs a stage to use a video stream in the place of an image map. This keyword is useful for animated textures.

Usage
-----

    videoMap [loop] [video]

Parameters
----------

-   [loop] - This parameter is optional and determines whether the specified video "loops".
-   [video] - the path and filename of the video.

Example
-------

{

       blend add
       texgen skybox
       videoMap loop video/mysky.roq
    }

Notes
-----

Video must be in [RoQ](ROQ_%28file_format%29 "ROQ (file format)") format.

This keyword can be used for [cube maps](Cube_maps "Cube maps") however you must meet the following requirements...

-   The video can be no larger than 256x1536 pixels.
-   Each of the 6 sides of the cubemap are stacked from top to bottom like so...
    -   PX
    -   NX
    -   PY
    -   NY
    -   PZ
    -   NZ
-   The PX and NX sides must be rotated so the orientation is the same as if it were a cubemap.
