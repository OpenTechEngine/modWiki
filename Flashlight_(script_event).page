Notes
-----

In the case of
[weapon\_flashlight](Weapon_flashlight_%28entity%29 "Weapon flashlight (entity)")
, the "mtr\_flashShader" key/value pair is set to "lights/flashlight5".
The reason for this is clear if you understand how the flashlight works.

Essentially it's using the muzzle flash light inherent to all weapons as
the flashlight's bulb. And since the [material
shader](Material_%28decl%29 "Material (decl)") used doesn't make use of
shader parms or time to determine the light's duration as is done with
other weapons, a script event (this event) is needed to toggle the light
on and off.

The key point being that this event is useless unless you intend to
toggle muzzle flashes off or give other weapons flashlights in which
case you'll need to edit the weapon's [entity
declaration](Entitydef_%28decl%29 "Entitydef (decl)") and more
specifically the "mtr\_flashShader" key/value pair.
