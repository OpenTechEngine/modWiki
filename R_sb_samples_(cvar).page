Notes
-----

This CVar is for the use of shadow buffers and it's not used by Doom 3.
With a usual shadow buffers implementation lights take snapshots of the
world and save it as textures. This CVar changes how many samples are
taken. More samples create softer shadows but introduce a performance
penalty.
